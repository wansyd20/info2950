The white cream is best suited for Heath Ledger's joker makeup (it cracks and flakes but stays on very well). Now I did apply this onto my skin so that may have been the problem, if you bought the latex &#34;demon&#34; mask it may have went on smooth, solid, and stayed together.<br />The black and red waxish markers just broke in half, and applying the black on loose skin (eye lids) it did not transfer very well.<br />The green stuff I got was a &#34;comb in&#34; gel that did not work, I have dark hair and it is not very thick (diameter along with amount). After applying some I found it did not show well in my hair. Plus there really wasn't enough to go all over my head my hair is only about 3/4 inch long and I have the same hair pattern as joker from arkham asylum (but I bought the joker wig so it was fine this was being use to fix the uncovered spots). So again if you are going for the Heath Ledger joker then fine, use a huge glob in spots to create accents of green when the light hits it.<br />Plus mine came with &#34;scars&#34; which looked like someone had molded the inside their mouth since the scars looked more like teeth. I did not use this as I've already got a tasteful scar on my face, why fake it LOL. The latex glue for this seemed dried up, I didn't open as I didn't need it.",2014-10-27

I thought this meant the bra was not padded.

Pleasantly Surprised!,"First off, I hardly ever review, so when I do, it means the product really had an impact on me.  This review is for first impressions, initial sound quality, fit, and comfort.  I have not tried placing calls, but I'm sure that's hit and miss with any bluetooth, etc.<br /><br />Ok - I do not have a large sized head - 6 7/8 in a starter cap.  These fit me PERFECT out of the box.  They are adjustable for medium to average sized heads.  I have owned the previous 180's and felt those stuck out too much in the back in the smallest setting and had to adjust them constantly - annoying.  These new bluetooth 180's had fleece type material in them, which is different than the picture featured, which is a good thing.  They keep my noggin' warm.<br /><br />Easy to pair with bluetooth - my iPhone has 4 bluetooth products programmed on it right now so I have a bit of experience with these wireless type of products - I hope one day science doesn't find that bluetooth causes cancer cus' I'd be screwed.  I'm also pretty picky with sound quality as I own JBL Studio Home Theater System, Premium Car Sound System with amp, and Klipsch S4 in-ear headphones.  I was surprised by the sound quality.  It was better than expected with more bass more than you'd think - reference dre beats headphone snobs/users steer clear, not for you - and not that type of product so ignore the pessimists on here.  I'll be rockin' these beauties on my way to downtown and throughout Denver - it's been known to hit neg 9 degrees in recent weeks.  Cheers.",2014-01-28

I get the smooth view from behind (not really my problem area), but no assist with the tummy. In fact, the fabric bunches a bit in front and accentuates my pooch ... yuck!

I am 6'2&#34; and weigh around 275, so I ordered the XXL size. Since I am long through the torso, it seems like when I pull it on over my shoulder that the overall length of it is a bit lacking for my torso length. If you tend to be more &#34;leggy&#34; or under 6 feet tall, it will probably be proportioned better for you.<br /><br />There is a problem with the buttons wanting to come loose within the first or second wearing. I've had to have my wife sew 3 of them back on already and a 4th one is now coming loose. With so many buttons on a union suit, it's a shame that these are coming loose so soon. It is an industry wide problem with buttons coming loose on garments, but this is way too fast. I am waiting for the day when the garment industry finds a way to better secure buttons on all garments. Who wants to spend time sewing them back on simply because they were not well attached in the first place.<br /><br />That matter aside, this is a good union suit that will keep you warm and comfy. Just watch out for any buttons coming loose and sew them on more securely or you'll lose them.",2015-03-06

It is also designer-inspired, meaning tht there is probably a very similar DIAMOND tiara available -- (for, of course, about 200 or more times the price!)  And -- it has THE hallmark of a great rhinestone tiara -- side combs, to enable a good, easy, and secure fit! : )    WHY am I sadly NOT buying this tiara?

So, I sadly cannot buy this wonderful tiara.  But I can put in a plea, here --to Bling Jewellery, and all other tiara makers -- to PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make tiaras with 9 or more inches of   rhinestones to attach to the headband.  Waitressing is an honourable profession -- but when waitresses, (or anyone else), uses a tiara -- for bridal, debut, prom, formal ball or other purposes -- the person wearing the tiara wants it to LOOK like a TIARA.... { : )   ....and NOT like a waitress's headpiece!

With that in mind and after reading some of the reviews I did order one to two sizes larger than I typically would.  I decided to try a 12.  I am 5'4, about 128lbs 36D.  The dress fit pretty good but required some alterations (which I expected).  Bridal dresses are cut very long, so unless you are 5'8 or taller, you will definitely need a hem.  The dress as a whole fit nice but the bust needed to be taken in a little as well as the straps,they were very loose.  Once we pinned the top strap to fit properly, we realized I would not be able to get my head out of it.  So my seamstress opened one side and put a set of hooks and eyes to easily close it and give me easier access to get in and out of it.<br /><br />I originally purchased this gown in the turquoise which was very pretty but decided the royal blue would be a better choice for what I needed it for.  The color is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />I would recommend this dress for its quality and style.  But would also suggest that a good seamstress may be needed to help get the fit that you would want.  I gave it four stars just because of the complexity of the bodice for alterations (but I fortunately have a great seamstress).<br /><br />Overall, I was very pleased with my purchase.  I have quite a few gowns and have never bought one from amazon before.  I will most likely try it again the next time I need a pretty dress.",2014-12-29

It was a bit small for a medium, but the folks at Killer Hats are awesome and talked me through the stretching process, which I was clueless about.  (If you own hats, you've gotta get a couple of hat jacks! Seriously had no idea that all hats shrink and those things are the best.)  Ok, back to the hat, great style, very well made and easier to shape than some of my other hats.  The hat band is stitch on in a few spots, others are usually glued, though personally, I'd prefer they weren't glued or stitched so I could swap them out if I wanted to, but this has a nice hat band that goes well with the embossed design.  Bullhide/Monte Carlo makes great hats and Killer Hats carries a ton of awesome hats.  They included a flyer with a discount code for future purchases, so I actually bought a few more hats from them direct.  I liked that I could actually call them and speak to someone about sizing and shaping and having folks there that were friendly and happy to help.",2012-08-10

Wow-my husbands jaw dropped like the dogs does begging for steak! This is one heck of a sexy top-cannot wait to rock this with jeans n heels on a night out!  I do however have a recommendation because I keep seeing reviews saying you cannot wear a bra...I can't go without one so trust me on this....YES you CAN wear with a bra!  You just need the right one.  There are loads of convertible bras out there ladies...I have a few from a very well known lingerie store that's known for their angels that worked just fine when I tried this on.  I like the low back bras or the ones that have a super low V-plunge in front because you never see them-they work great in my other Patty tops too-I have the one with chains down the back, the cowl drape one with a tube top under, another chain one and a few others that my back is exposed or its low in front-they work great with these tops and add a little more sexy to them!  I think to get the full effect of a top like this you just might want a bra-just my two cents.  Another suggestion I have is obviously this is clingy down the middle and back-if you upsize it will make the rouching more abundant so if you have a middle that isn't perfect this may be what you'd want to do. It is pretty form fitting but in a good way.  I LOVE this top! I want the dress version now too!",2013-04-29

I did a few things to change the way the world perceived me.  First thing I did is purchase a 1981 Chevy El Camino with an Edelbrock intake and a number 8 across the hood in honor of Dale (R.I.P.), I pierced my ear, shaved in my rat tail, and most importantly i purchased the Unicorn Castle T-shirt. This shirt has changed the way I view myself and the way the world views me.  Girls can't seem to stay away from me to the point that is almost annoying.  Something about mystical unicorns make chick think that I am a mystical kind of dude.  Many girls have mistaken this shirt for a \\""My Little Pony\\"" and I quickly have to set them straight.  With the rise of Emo music it has made it cool for men to grow their hair long, tease their hair, wear make up and womens clothing so you can imagine how emo i look with a few scars and my purple unicorn shirt.  I recommend buying a size smaller than you normally wear and ordering this with a bottle of spray on tan so that you looked extra jacked and tan.  NOTE: Girls love mystical guys that are jacked and tan.  If you really wanna real them in get a book on palm reading or some tarot cards as well to add to the mysticism of your new persona.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this shirt.  3 Wolf Moon is outdated and it is time for a unicorn revolution.  It is the unicorns time to shine and shine it does with a beautiful rainbow glistening in the background.",2010-05-25

Order True To Your Size!,"Absolutely tickled with this purchase!  I got the blue and while I wished the blue was a bit more vibrant/royal, it's still lovely (it's more navy than pictured).  I ordered a size 6 (my size) and it fits immaculately...like a glove.  Love the sweatshirtish material and the plaid lining gives it a fun and posh touch. For the price, this is an amazing deal, and I'm strongly considered ordering this in red and gray.  The seaming details and other finishes give this an upscale look.  Great buy and highly recommend.  Ignore the comments about ordering differently than your size and when you click on the sizes, only look at American sizing and ignore the European &#34;size up&#34;.  Clearly the vendor knows the American version of European sizing.  I'm a straight-up size 6 and that is what I ordered.  That is a European size 10 and my coat says, &#34;Medium&#34;, though I'm a small here in the US.  Also...there seems to be major confusion on what type of &#34;coat&#34; this is.  Clearly, there is no wool in this coat and there is no reason for any purchaser to feel that this should have the same warmth and wear as a wool coat or a coat with wool.  This would do well in the temps of 40s and 50s.  Maybe the 30s with layers underneath.  Just keep this in mind and adjust expectations.",2015-04-08

I am a  57 yr old  man,  with a physic that of a 25 year old, lean muscle body very little body fat.<br />I am 5'-7&#34; tall weigh an average of 139 lbs, 39&#34; chest 29-30&#34; waist, firm bubbled tush (so I am told! lol)  and lean thighs and calves.<br /><br />(I credit all this to a good gene pool. My father was the same up till his late 70's then he started that spread around that mid-section, he is now 85 and still looks GRT!. still see the muscle definition in his biceps, thighs, calves' .. Only real noticeable change is his torso, things have started soften and heading South just a tad!. But! only because  he isn't as physically active now. he looks amazing for his age. He is now stretching, walking 3-4 miles a day, heading to the gym light / medium weights and wow! he is transforming back to his 40's look. And having a positive attitude is a major contributor. His belly has shrunk from a size 37 to now a 31!.. Very proud of him. Mom is the same.)<br /><br />So! finding cloths to fit just this type of build is difficult at any age. But! esp being a middle aged man, I have problems finding the type or style of clothing that complements not just my body type, But! my age.  I live in Houston, TX and if any one has visited or lived here you know how grueling our summers are, Actually we have only 2 seasons summer and a very short winter.  Summers are hot humid and down right unbearable.  So! clothing that breaths is very important.  The normal attire for these types of days are T-shirts, shorts , sandals/flip flops..  I do have a very large selection of all the above. So! finding shorts that not only complement my look and age appropriate was a very daunting task.  Most clothing manufacture cater  to the younger segment, which means loose/baggy jeans that sit on the hip and expose their underwear, as they walk they constantly are pulling their jeans up!. Very tacky looking and has to be very uncomfortable to say the least.<br /><br/>So! searching for clothing I want to see on me and in public without the negative remarks from passer byes!. This was a very difficult task.  Well Levi's past in all categories.  I ordered this 1 pair at first. I received them and put them on and they fit perfectly not to baggy not to snug,, right length down  just above the knee!! around the hip and tush  and the waist! was a bit loose. The 30&#34; was actually a 31&#34;, But! that is grt! . Because the shorts fit perfectly in every other area.  The extra 1 inch in the waist allows one to tuck in ones shirt and affords that nice snug fit without being to tight or restrictive.  I wear a undershirt  when I wear a polo type shirt or a button down oxford while wearing shorts. Of course if I wear just  T-shirt then of course no undershirt.<br /><br />But! the point being these cargos have lived up to my expectations and then some. Well made design and comfort.<br /><br />I have since ordered 2 more pair in 1 kaki and olive.",2013-11-24

I am between a size 2 and 4, and after reading the sizing guide, decided to order this dress in a 2.  The top fit perfectly (which was a relief, since I am a 32DDD and often size 2 can be too small in the bust) but the waist was HUGE.  You can even see the oddness of it in the advertising images/video of the dress if you look closely.  It is shaped very strangely, and does not tuck inward at the waist as it should.<br /><br />Because I love the fabric, color, and top of the dress, I decided to get it tailored -- and they are having to take it in around 2 full inches on BOTH sides of my waist!  I have around a 26&#34; waist, so having an extra 4 inches in a size 2 is absolutely absurd.  Because I got a good deal on the dress ordering from here I don't mind quite so much that I'm having to spend extra to get it taken in, but it's still an added hassle.

The jagged lace at the bottom is absolutely lovely! I was afraid the material would be thin and cheap but it really is not!<br />I'm a size 18-20 and have always had kind of wide hips.

As soon as I tried the dress on the first thing I noticed was the adjustable straps, which thank goodness or it wouldn't of fit my breast at all! After loosening the straps as far as possible, I could just squeeze it over my chest. The strings in the front are pretty much just for show so they were no help. But, as for the rest of the dress, it fits actually pretty perfect!! Being white and silky, I figured it'd show every wrinkle, bump and bulge. But, it actually flattered my shape and hips SO nicely!! I was shocked!! Haha Even my sides and back looked nice and smooth! I'm 5'3 and in tennis shoes, the longest &#34;lacey jag&#34; of the hem came about an inch above the floor. It's perfect!!!<br />I could not be happier with this dress except the breast area. The page says &#34;one size&#34; fits bust size 40'-50' in and me being a 40 DD, I think the measurements are a bit on the smaller side and should be more accurately stated.<br />But, I would totally recommend this seller and dress to any bigger girl looking for a pretty feminine dress to make them feel beautiful! ^_^",2015-03-05

It's short - yes. The ruffle bottom reminds me of a cheerleader skirt, but it's very flattering! I like how the material is soft and it hugs your body (it doesn't drape around your torso/belly). The chest part was a little small at first - I'm a 36D - but the material stretches as you wear it, so I just gave it some time and it adjusted to my body perfectly. You can wear this with the halter tie, or as a tube dress and tie it in the front in a bow.<br /><br />I wore this dress about 80% of the time this summer, and got so many compliments. HOWEVER! Realize this is a CHEEAAAPP dress. You WILL get those little lint balls that show up on clothing after you wash it, even if you hand wash it like I did! However, if you take a standard razor to it you can get them off pretty easily. As well, mine started to rip a bit on the seams, but some thread and a needle fixed it just fine.<br /><br />For the price, it's right. It could definitely be made of much better materials and just be better quality in general, but it's cute and there's not a lot of dresses like it out there.",2014-10-21

I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh around 145 lbs., I ordered a medium, and while it fit good around my waist, it was kind of short; I expect my maxi skirts to touch the ground and this one didn't, so it kind of looked a little awkward on me.

It is quite a bit smaller than my previous one (a regular bifold with individual card slots) and fits much better in my pocket. The cards are easy to access with the pull tabs, although there is a bit of  mental overhead in remember which slot particular cards are in. I'm not a huge fan of the money clip concept but I am getting used to it. The biggest drawback is that you can only fit 5 regular cards in each pocket comfortably. You can put a sixth in but it gets a bit tight. I would have liked to have room for a few more cards, but it does make you think about which cards you really need to carry.  Update 5/20/16: After about a year, the money clip started coming out and the leather trim was peeling. The sent me a replacement for free. It seems to be a bit better quality than my original one - there is definitely some extra stitching to hold the money clip in.",2015-03-06

True to Size!,"The review that says you can get these at Walmart is wrong. Walmart carries something very similar, but if you look at the details on Walmart's web site, the ones they sell are NOT cotton, but spandex and nylon--despite Walmart's incorrect label of \\""cotton\\"".  Also, their style # is different. The style # of these hi cuts through Kohl's is 43CKWH and they are 100% cotton. At Kohls on sale they run about $9 for 3. However, I also found them at [...] for $[...] for 3 pair,their style # H43JS. So, the comparison with Walmart is apples to oranges.       Personally, I found these to be extremely comfortable, excellent spun cotton quality, correct in size and the only briefs I can wear with my allergies. If they had spandex in them, believe me, I would know it! What I needed most was cotton hi cuts where the elastic in the waistband is covered with the cotton fabric, not exposed. These are perfect--no elastic touching my skin.       So, try these before you judge or compare to something that looks similar, but is not, at Walmart.

I got three.<br /><br />I am 5'5\\"" and wear an XS, since that doesn't exist in this dress, I ordered the Small. Its slightly roomy, but considering that its a $12 cotton knit basic, I do not care. Now...be warned taller than average buyer...these are short. I'm about average height and these dresses end about two inches below the lowest part of my butt cheeks, so I only wear them with opaque tights or leggings. The fabric is also a little transparent, which you can only see up close and in bright light (another reason for tights, but this is such a minimal issue in the darker colors its just for peace of mind), but hey...they were $12. I ordered the black and navy, which really look fine, I'd imagine lighter colors would be more transparent. They are fitted in the shoulders/chest/armpit area, but aren't really fitted in the waist area and the back hangs straight down, which might be why some people are saying they're super small and others saying they're baggy.

I will say that I am used to bikinis, but have had a couple of pairs of &#34;more coverage&#34; type panties. I thought I would try these as I saw a tv segment on briefs being the &#34;secret&#34; comfort item that women have. These seemed great, as they have &#34;comfort&#34; in their name! Well, to look at them, they are almost embarrassingly large, but I decided to try to get past that. The issue I have with them is their fit. The waistband and leg hole bands are SO tight. (And yes, I'm wearing the correct size.) The problem with them is that they (the bands) are not actually made of elastic (or an elastic material) like most underwear is. It appears to just be the underwear material folded over and sort of hemmed. I guess because the material itself is somewhat stretchy (not the stretchiest ever, though) they decided that it could just double as the trim. Well, it does not stretch or give at all, which makes them dig in. Perhaps this style of banding would work better on a bikini cut or something (although I think there would still be an issue with the waistband). The only reason I'm not giving a 1 star rating is because the rest of the panty is somewhat comfortable - although my ideal would be a softer material.",2015-07-29

I'm not a serious cyclist, rather I'm trying to commute to work and find good clothes. I've owned a few other pairs of bike clothes, but wouldn't consider myself an expert on them.     With those caveats out of the way, these are really nice jerseys, and a great value for the money. They seem very well-made, comfortable, and sized accurately. The fabric breathes really well, and given that I am in a humid tropical location, I appreciate that. I've stayed very cool on the warmer afternoon rides home from work.  It does seem like the fabric is pretty wind-resistant too.  One nice touch is that there is no label inside, rather the contents of what would be on a label are printed directly inside the back of the jersey.    The jerseys are simple, no glitzy logos or wild designs. I feel like just riding in bike clothes gets enough attention, so I value the plainness.     I can't vouch for the long-term durability of these things, but so far I've been very pleased with them and intend to buy more. The printed \\""label\\"" states you can machine wash them -- hooray!

I tried Hanes regulars from Target.  Regular rise, not low rise, apparently not available.  $10 for 5 pairs, so good price.  The fabric has held up fairly well thru multiple washings.  My biggest complaint is that they are not low rise, and the leg elastic has not held up at all. It defeats the purpose of briefs if my testicles are constantly escaping and hanging (uncomfortably!) out of the leg openings.  I'll not buy these again at any price.  When I saw on Amazon that FOTL offered low rise briefs, I gave them a try.  I ordered 2 - 5 packs to get \\""free\\"" shipping.  Shipping was fast, as usual from Amazon.  The colors don't match the description, but this is not a big deal to me, just as long as they are NOT white!  I washed them and am now wearing the first pair.  They are slightly baggier than Jockeys and not as \\""low\\"" rise.  So I'm in the minority who would like them a little snugger in the seat.  The quality of the elastic in the waist band and legs seems okay so far.  They keep everything where it should be. I read one reviewer commenting on the fly front.  Yes, there is more parting and unfolding required to extract my penis for #1.  This is not all bad, however.  The Jockey Y front fly is easier to use, but I have always found when not using the fly, my penis often escaped with no purpose and nowhere to go.  Once again defeating the purpose of briefs.  So the more difficult fly on the FOTL's does a better job of containment when not in use. The more secure fly is not a deal breaker for me.  I'll see how these hold up over time and try to addend this review later. Four stars so far, but I just got them.  Stay tuned.<br /><br />Update - 12/9/13 - Okay, I've worn these for 6 months now.  The elastic waist, legs, and fabric are holding up so far thru several wearings and wash/dry cycles.  The plant where they are sewn is a little sloppy.  One of the 10 pairs I bought had separated stitching at one of the seams where the panels attach on the bottom, right out of the package new.  A more telling error is the fly.  It consists of an outer opening on the right and an inner opening on the left.  All the outer fly openings are uniformly 4\\"", however some of the inner fly openings are under sized by 1-2\\"".  This makes them impossible to use and therefore flyless briefs.  Since these are sewn on a pattern, this sloppy inconsistency is hard to understand and forgive.  Because of this, I'm downgrading them to 3 stars.  I would go lower but the rest is holding up well so far.  I'll add more when they begin to wear out.  Stay tuned.s.

The description for the \\""Big\\"" version of this product states that it's \\""100% Polyester\\"", while it says here that it's \\""100% cotton\\"". The tag on the shirt also says that it's 100% polyester, but it feels like it's made out of plastic water bottles.

What I didn't expect was for one of the buttons to fall off while trying it on for the first time (still deciding whether to return it or see if I can sew a button onto a plastic water bottle.) All that aside, the fit is surprisingly good for a Dickies brand top, considering how they're usually very wide and very short. It's a shame that Dickies can't put more effort into making better quality products, because I think they'd sell a lot more if they did.

I ended up getting an US L / Asia XXL which is not toooooo big, but does not taper to the body as much as I would like.  In fact, the length is what I wanted.  The extra size gives it a slightly loose look if that's what you're going for.  The hood is big as well in a good way, since I like having a big hood.  The shoulders are just a little large but you can hardly tell.  I imagine if I got the Medium Plus, that would probably fit me perfectly while still having the aspects I like.<br /><br />The pockets are pretty big, but they're angled in such a way that I wouldn't trust to put anything into them except the smallest of things.  So the big pockets are just for show basically.  The material is super thin.

In the package was a note from the seller apologizing for the delay in shipping because the original package had been lost and a new order had to be shipped. It's a beautiful coat but there are 2 reasons why I'm returning the coat. 1: I had read the prior reviews and knew that the coat ran small so I ordered the XXL. Well the XXL is more like a XS-XM size. While the length was perfect, I could not zip up the coat. 2: Defective zipper. I could not unzip the zipper from the bottom without using a force. I had to hold the top of the coat tight while my husband pulled down on the zipper. After about 5 minutes of pulling the zipper finally came loose.

I actually bought it through the Ebay storefront (saddleback has an Ebay store with factory seconds). This is one of those bags. the handle was of center and the left corner was a little wrinkled but i dont care, i got it for a way, way cheaper price than the 580 dollars on amazon(i got extra large)    first, people will look at the bag. people see it and it really is so attractive and pictures dont do it justice. the bag came with busness cards and a pocket bible as the CEO/presidente is religious.    i emptied my briefcase and started filling the bag. it is heavy but i didnt find it to be too bulky.there are all sorts of neat compartments for your stuff. the side pockets are a little small and dont really fit a 20 oz soda but i dont care. even with the handle being offset, the bag is no problem to use with the steel plate reinforcement under the handle.    i havent tried using it as a backpack but the thing is really spacious. the biggest thing that i like about it so far is that i can sit it on the passenger side of my car and it is not going anywhere. it has a lot of form and will not tip over unless you really want it to. just looking at the construction of the thing i can tell that it can stand up to a lot of abuse. imagine taking an actual saddle and converting it into a bag, it feels that durable.    walking aroung town with it is very comfortable. it does not jiggle and repeatedly tap on your back or hip like other bags because it is so sturdy. but it is heavy. the flap does cover the contents as promised to protect what is inside from rain.    i understand that munson did not put clips on it to close the flap so i guess in time i will probably get a carabeener to close the flap as i am not really into buckling the front every time.    i feel very indiana jones like i am about to pull out a crystal skull out of it or something and cant stop the indiana jones music. the coffee brown color also helps.",2008-07-29

The collar zips up to cover your nose if you want it too.  The hood is huge which might be a bit of a problem but it can be adjusted.  The only difficulty is that the coat is a bit heavy.

Note: these are NOT the same as the poly/cotton version of the same pants.  A call to Atlanco/Tru-Spec confirmed these are authentic Crye Multicam material, [not far east knock-offs] certified for low NIR (near infrared) reflectivity.  They are less likely to be seen by those using night vision devices, as the profile is similar to surrounding vegetation.  They are also tougher in abusive environments than the poly/cotton version. The downside of course, is that these NYCO pants are more expensive than the poly/cotton, non-NIR ones.  One minor detail: there is vertical stitching just to the right of the button fly, that seems like it should be hidden by the fly.  However, it might just be the design, as I have another pair of camo pants, by another manufacturer, with exactly the same issue.  It's nothing functional, just an observation, and would only really matter if these were dress pants! XL Regular fit great for both waist and inseam.  I believe the size is for 39\\"" to 41\\"" waist, and up to 32.5\\"" length.  A comparison of this multicam pattern with woodland, digital woodland (Marine digicam), the Army all purpose digicam and MOC's xcam in N Florida woods showed multicam to be more effective in this reviewer's opinion. I would definately buy another pair.  Delivery from Panda as on time as scheduled.",2009-11-11

It is standard to sub quality but exactly what I expected for the price. It's got a lot going on with zippers and shoulder buttons, but the right shoulder fabric has me and my fiancée referring to it as the &#34;matador shirt.&#34; Which makes it a fun shirt to wear to events.  The positives: The slim fit. I got the size I usually wear in t-shirts and the &#34;matador shirt&#34; had this flattering slim fit. Also, the shirt is very thin and therefor not hot. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing a dress shirt, which I like.  The negatives: So many loose strings. Both attached to the shirt that need to be cut and on the shirt that can be picked off. Also, the collar is ridiculously tall, taller than it looked in the pictures (which may not be a bad thing to all buyers). I am concerned with the shirt ripping due to the large quantity of strings cut/pulled off and the thinness of the shirt. Time will tell if the shirt holds up.",2015-08-17

I read an article how it was important to bind your abs to help bring the muscles back together after having a baby. With this being my 4th, I decided I should do it. My abs and lower back were killing me and this gave me great support and helped my stomach go down so much faster than with my previous babies. I liked that this was long, from right under my chest through the hips.  I wouldn't wear it out, because it does add bulk, but I would wear it around the house and when I slept. As my stomach got smaller and you pull it tighter it is annoying as another reviewer also pointed out that the velcro is longer and hangs over, so it might rub against the skin if you are wearing low cut underwear. I looked into so many others, but I didn't want one that covered the crotch area, which is sensitive after giving birth and it's already difficult enough getting to the bathroom in time. Plus, I didn't want to spend $100 or more. This did the job and was great for the price too. If you want something to wear out of the house, I would probably get the postpartum support that Motherhood Maternity sells in addition to this. Because this one is so long it bunches around the waste and you have to readjust it. I got a size small, but I didn't get this until 2 weeks after I delivered. Pre-pregnancy I was a size 4 and I'm 5'6\\"" tall, and I was a size Small to Medium, maternity size 6 during the pregnancy. Hopefully that helps you figure out what size you would need.",2012-11-08

I've tried Gore-Tex and it's layered barrier clones. Those breathable suits are great for hiking through light mist. But, in terms of having a full Nor'Wester suit that can keep one dry while chasing critters through a monsoon, PVC is still (regrettably), the standard. After having other rain jackets fail us, we bought his and hers Carhartt PVC rain suits including the bibs, and they've become our working standards for protection against serious downpours and high winds.    I got the extra large tall thinking that I wanted to make sure I had room enough underneath for lots of layering. I needn't have bothered since these are quite generously cut as it is. I'm very pleased with the overall quality of construction and the attention to detail. It's little things like having waterproof stretchy cuffs and reinforced wear areas such as the knees on the bibs that set the Carhartt rain gear apart from the competition such as the Stearn gear. The suits have proven to be surprisingly tough. Mine has stood up to briars, sharp straw, metal roofing tin and serious amounts of mud. That was one of the failure points of the permeable barrier type jackets. Get them good and dirty and they stop working. That's not an issue with these heavy duty PVC rain suits, though they don't \\""breathe\\"" at all and I generally choose to come out of it as soon as the rain blows over.

Quite nice actually. The denim fabric used is of pretty high quality. They have a very nice wash and just look sort of expensive. The non-contrast stitching is also nice, as its much more minimalist. The problem is getting these jeans from Amazon. One of two things is happening:<br /><br />A. Amazon gets factory seconds... meaning they are of SERIOUSLY reduced quality/craftsmanship.<br /><br />B. Naked and famous quality control sucks.<br /><br />I tend to think its the former, as I've tried on Naked and Famous jeans at Nordstrom with no problems. The jeans I got had totally messed up selvedge. At the very bottom of the selvendge, it's actually sewn over onto itself. That is completely messed up, as the red line selvedge is a HUGE reason people buy raw denim. Also... even if the selvedge wasn't folded and sewn, the selvedge on each leg isn't even in size! They differ by about 1/8 of an inch. This might not bother some people... but it DEFINITELY bothers me. At $140... you shouldn't have to worry about this stuff.<br /><br />Whether Amazon gets factory seconds or Naked and Famous quality control sucks, either way you're better off buying these at Nordstrom where you can inspect the quality first hand.

I was trying to be careful with it, but the plastic wouldn't give.<br /><br />I had also ordered the Bravado nursing bra, and the clips on that are metal, so there isn't a problem with them breaking.  Also, for whatever reason, the nursing bra clips are just easier to operate (than the nursing camisole clips).<br /><br />Sigh.  This has so much potential too.  What a shame.  Amazon was a peach and accepted the return.",2013-08-14

They cost me $60 dollars, which felt like a mint at the time, but they turned out to be my best friend for my entire stay at the job.     I wore them all summer long for ROUGH 8-day shifts. I climbed mountains, waded streams, and sat on sand, stone, and occasionally cactus, and they held up great-- no rips, no wearing, and almost no staining. (They do let cactus spines through, though.) Best of all, they were COOL. Due to dress code, I couldn't utilize the zip-off feature, but never minded in the slightest because they're nylon and  breathe so well.  I LOVE all the pockets. Two cargo pockets on the thighs, one in the back, a passport one hidden inside the back pocket, and don't forget the one hidden down inside the left leg! They regularly held the following: my big knife, my handkerchief, my big map, my water drops, my flashlight/headlamp, my pens, my paperwork (in baggies), and god knows what else when I needed the room. And the pockets are MESH, so you don't have extra material gathered around where your body is going to produce the most heat.    In the winter I did manage to get some burn holes in the legs--tiny, the size of a floating cinder-- but the edges melted around and they never ripped like cotton certainly would have. They amazing thing was that I wore these not only all summer, but into the 0-degree weather of winter with the simple addition of a pair of long underwear (waterproof outers for cold rain, too). And again, the pants would dry tremendously fast if they got wet, and they were almost windproof. I hate the cold, so believe me-- if I felt like I needed warmer pants, I would have bought them!     My one complaint is the silly velcro on the inside bottom of the legs that apparently is there to let you zip-off and take off the pant legs to make shorts without having to take off your boots. (Why you would be wearing boots when it's hot enough for shorts is beyond me-- that's what a good pair of hiking sandals is for.) The trouble with that is that if you're walking in brush, twigs can tend to catch on the pant leg and unstick the velcro, and suddenly you're wearing bell-bottoms and the pant legs start catching on even more stuff. If you really hate it though, you can always safty-pin the pants, and no problemo.     I also appreciated the fit of these pants. Nice & snug around the waist so no need for an uncomfortable belt in addition to my pack belt, but still roomy though butt &  hips. This isn't a outerwear brand I'd even heard of before, but I want to spread the word now! They're great pants! I'm going to buy another pair for a camping trip this summer :)",2008-02-10

We had used polyester and cotton sleep sacks before, but always found that they caused her to overheat and get sweaty if the temperature in our house wasn't perfect, (living on the East Coast, our houses are notoriously draughty and getting the temperature right can be tough).    I noticed a difference as soon as she had woken up from the first night of wearing it.  She wasn't too hold or cold and was perfectly snug.  As a big night time pee'er, it's not uncommon for me to find her sleep sack wet in the morning, and even though she peed through her diaper that first night, the inside of the sleep sack was bone dry.  Somehow the fabric had wicked and moved away the pee from her body and through to the outside of the sleep sack.  Amazing!    These sleep sacks are definitely not in the same price range as cheapo polyester and cotton sleep sacks, but in terms of features and benefits, there's no competition.

However, I feel the worst the economy, the quality of designer jeans (e.g. Paige, Joe's Jeans, etc) has gotten worst as well. I wanted to go back the basics and cult favorite. These Levi's are great. I love the original Levi's back pocket stitching. I'm 5'6\\"", 111 lbs. I'm and an XS or size 0 in most clothing brands (Express, Bebe, BCBG). Since the smallest size in this Levi's line is size 4, I was concern that the 4 will still be too big even knowing these jeans run small. Right out of the bag, the jeans felt just a tad loose around the waist and thigh. So, I threw it in the wash and voila perfect fit. Although the thigh could be a little tighter. I don't mind though. The jeans are mid rise. So, I don't have to worry about pulling up my jeans when sitting or bending down. The material is soft and very comfy to wear and most importantly, great fitting. This is a MUST buy, even for jean snobs. BTW - I purchase them in \\""Soft Glow\\"". I'm about to order another pair in \\""Deep Night\\"".",2012-11-09

He is built very much like me with big hands, large neck and chest and long arms, so fitting can be problematical, especially when ordering on line. I ordered a large and was not disappointed. Whereas the ThinkGeek Minecraft University Kids' Hoodie was a little too short in the arm length, but doable for the short term, he ought to be able to where this one all winter. But like the other hoodie, there are great doubts about next fall.

To all of the reviewers claiming that you need to order a size or even two sizes up, please do other buyers a favor and be honest with yourself and your measurements. Just because you want to fit into a small doesn't mean you are a small. I stupidly took your advice and ordered XL where I usually wear M (5'6&#34;, ~140), and once it arrived it was way too big and I had to spend the whole morning altering it and entirely remove a couple of panels.

I have no problem nursing my child in public in the least bit. I do like to maintain modesty if at all possible wherever I may be nursing my child be it at home or in a busy mall.I was recently given the opportunity to review the Undercover Mama undershirt.  I've reviewed quite a few undershirts to make a nursing mother's life easier. So far this one I've had the best experience with and let me tell you why and how this one works!<br />The Undercover Mama is designed so you don't have to go out and buy a bunch of nursing tops. If you're a nursing mother I'm sure you've noticed that nursing tops in general cost a lot more than your typical top. But with this nursing undershirt you can keep on dressing the way you like without breaking the budget on overpriced ( in my opinion) nursing clothes.<br />How this top works is that it has clips that attach to the clips of your nursing bra or to the strap of a regular bra. I like this feature for a number of reasons! Number one, you can keep using this undershirt as an extra layer long after you finish nursing your child! Number 2, is the fact that when I un-clip my bra to nurse, the shirt un-clips too.<br />I've been wearing this top a lot since I received it. I wanted to give it the ultimate review plus after a day or so of wear, I knew I couldn't live without it! I'm naturally cold so I love layering but I was always having the problem with my undershirt rising up but with this top since it attaches to my bra, I no longer have that annoying issue that exposes my back and stomach.If you are not a fan of the layered look but want to keep yourself covered still, feel free to tuck this undershirt in. It will stay put, I promise you.",2011-02-23

Back then, these were unwired bras, which I loved, so when I came back to purchase another (I am nursing twins now and felt like I can stand to go up a size), I was surprised and a little disappointed that the larger sizes (ONLY the larger sizes; check the Cake website) are now wired. I ordered anyway because I love everything else about this bra, and having some other wired Cake bras, I thought I would give it a go. The lining of the bra is a floral printed cotton, and there are several rows of hooks in the back for a ribcage in flux. I love this, because my ribcage usually continues to go down in size postpartum and it's nice to not have to buy new bras as a result. The cup is molded, and is not as easy to clip all the way down as an unlined nursing bra might be, or a thinner molded cup (like their mousse bra). However, I'm used to this. The bra will temporarily crease, but if the bra fits you, it's going to be gone within a few moments of you clipping it back up. If you're a prime member, take advantage of the free returns and make sure it fits before you start wearing it around! :) The underwire they've added now feels even more supportive. This is definitely not a bra you'll want to sleep in, not because it's not comfortable (it should be if you're wearing the right size), but because there's so much support happening that I just wouldn't want to sleep in it. I wear their Cotton Candy bras for that -- I have three of those. Love them too!<br /><br />Support level: This is by far the most supportive bra I own. The cups, the band, and the straps are all made to last and made to hold you up! This bra is far more supportive than their mousse bras (which I wear in an E cup) -- those are definitely less supportive and more stretchy (both in the cup, straps, and band).<br /><br />Durability: I am still wearing the ones I bought from 2011--those were in use for a year then and during my pregnancy, and now 10 weeks postpartum. Those two are still in amazing condition.<br /><br />Care: I have no idea what Cake recommends, but due to some serious battles with thrush, I wear my bras one time before they are machine washed on hot in a lingerie bag and then machine dried on medium, and they hold up like champs.<br /><br />Bottom line is I love this bra--I did way back when, and three years later, even with the new underwire, I'm still a fan!those were in use for a year then and during my pregnancy, and now 10 weeks postpartum.

I have a few DiVinci shirts and I wear a large in that brand. With all the talk of how big these shirt are, everyone is right. In most shirts like this I wear a X-Lg except DiVinci.<br /><br />I ordered a Large in this brand of shirt. The shirt hangs well from my chest, as my chest is bigger than my stomach, but the length is 3 inches longer than it should be. The sleeve length is good but could be a little shorter. If I would order another one, I'd actually order a medium, but I will probably stick with the DaVinci brand and others that I can actually try on in a store.<br /><br />The material is heavy, very soft and it does have a slight wrinkle factor to it which will require an occasional ironing, however, I washed and dried as directed and it came out of the dryer practically wrinkle-free.<br /><br /> Due to the heaviness, I wouldn't ware it out in the open sun for more than 15 minutes. It's a nice late-afternoon to night time shirt if waring outside.<br /><br /> What I do not like on it are the ends of the sleeves. I didn't catch how they have a fold style to them and have a very small button at the bottom of the sleeve which isn't too noticeable and I will most likely remove the button. The button totally throws off the stylish look but due<br />to this different style of bowling shirt, it's worth having one shirt, but that's about it for me.<br /><br />You'd be hard pressed to find a shirt as nice as this one for such a low price. I keep my eyes out for these style of shirts and I've never found one as nice as this for such a low cost which is why I took a chance of buying it and I'm happy I did so. I've spent more money on lesser quality. I suppose if I were just starting a Charlie Sheen type of look/collection, I'd buy 3 of them.<br /><br />Even with the negatives I've expressed, this is a very well made shirt from China. It will yield a long life and if you're going tobuy one, get a size smaller than you usually ware and just buy one at a time so you can get the size right for you if buying multiple shirts.<br /><br />For those who have guts bigger than they should be, due to the heavy material, I'd imagine you'd not like how the shirt will most likely define how much overweight you are. This is where I'm assuming most people who give this shirt a low rating have a problem.<br /><br />I'm giving it five stars despite the negatives due to the quality and price. I recieved it in a plastic USPS PRIORITY Mail bag/package, 4 business days after I ordered it from Dallas, Texas.",2014-05-17

However, even from this picture, I didn't see the extra fading on legs- front top of leg to knee, and even greater fading on the rear. I don't care for this feature on jeans. The flannel is a cranberry color rather than what you'd expect pink to be. These have a very small amount of curviness, but not the amount seen in the picture here on amazon - perhaps smaller sizes have this. They seem to be well made and are thick - they are noticeably heavier than a regular pair of jeans. Bottom line for me- disappointing just because sellers can't describe their items properly.

He loved this wallet and I was happy to find the exact same one on here so I ordered it for him for Christmas. Fast forward less than a year and the same thing happened, the stitching around the velcro tore open. Normally this wouldn't be a huge issue, the velcro closure is nice but not completely necessary. The problem lies in the fact that when that stitching tears, or at least when it did in this case, it tears open the zipper pouch on that side. That's where my boyfriend would keep his spare car key and house key (he has almost never forgotten his wallet, but often forgets his keys), luckily when it fell out he noticed.<br /><br />So overall this is a decent wallet, but keep in mind the issue with stitching for the velcro tearing. I'm only taking two stars off since that may not be an issue for some people, but if you do want to keep semi-valuable things in that zippered pocket, I would not recommend this wallet.",2013-02-26

But the jacket is very loose and way too long for me. And given the positioning of the belt-wrap tailoring to my dimensions is too difficult. The mask is also an oversized plastic molding with no flex or bend to it. The mask is very much larger than my head and face and almost looks as big as a storm trooper mask. The picture for the costume is misleading and should not be a deciding factor in purchasing this product.<br />I gave one star because the mask size is misleading, and the jacket is truly made to fit a size 44 person as a loose/relaxed fit.

Very happy with the quick shipment! I am prego with my 4th baby and my vulvar veriscosities have progressively gotten worse, and this pregnancy they are unbearable. I bought the band and groin straps at 32 weeks along. I was desperate for some relief (yes, I wear compression pantyhose, but they were not helping). This band and straps have made a world of a difference! I can actually be on my feet all day with out all the pain and with out feeling completely worn down at night. I just can't tell you how much relief this product provides and how much better I feel!!! Well worth it! I am a size 2-4 and ordered a small, and am very happy with the fit. I was very worried that the bands would be seen through my pants, but they are not noticeable when I wear jeans (even skinny jeans), and actually are barely noticeable in yoga pants. When I wear leggings I just make sure to wear my compression maternity panty hose and then the bands aren't visable at all.

I knew fully well that they were not originals but, I didn't expect what I got.  They were only about half the thickness, if that, which made them extremely flimsy and loose in both my frames.  Lastly, the polarization was a joke!  There was none that I could see even remotely resembled factory Oakley lenses and the coloring was off.  Just as you see the different color on the outside of the lens, it's the same looking out from the inside and very distracting and annoying!  I couldn't deal with them at all so, I will just be spending the money to back to factory originals.

Although noticeably low rise, the Lucky Brand Slim Bootleg is not radically low rise and is a good, fashionable, safe style of slim fitting low rise for those guys still hesitant to make the switchover from baggy/loose fitting to slim fitting jeans.  The Slim Bootcut also makes for a more age-appropriate look as opposed to some of the really skinny-leg low and slim fits, and overall is probably a much more age-appropriate look for older guys than many of the baggy styles that still exist.",2007-05-18

I like the style very much & think it is sized well. I normally wear a long white robe and was tired of them looking drab/dirty over time as they picked up on makeup, etc. I think the length is very good as it is just above my knee & the robe overall gives me a nice shape which hopefully my husband will appreciate. I'm 5'7\\"" & 140 - 145 lbs. there is plenty of room for a larger woman yet the robe doesn't look too large on me. My issue only with the robe is that the material is super thin, like that of a thin t-shirt. When I put it on the hook behind my bathroom door I am extra gentle as I worry about the hook poking a hole through the material. Also, the thinness makes it less than ideal for an all-year round robe which is what I was looking for (I live in the NE so have 4 seasons). I would love to see Calvin Klein offer the same style in a heavier cotton material, preferably one that is absorbent as I like to wear my robes straight out of the shower.

I'd been without a proper engineer's cap for many years, and I missed wearing one, but I didn't fancy spending the dough on one only to have the &#34;one size fits all&#34; label fail me yet again, hence why I skipped over the other makes and selected this one, and I am happy to say I got myself a cap that fits very well.<br /><br />Don't let the fact that this comes from a costume supply outfit put you off, this hat is very nicely made, and has stood up to being worn day-in-day-out for years around real steam locomotives (didn't think I bought it just as fashion statement, did ya?), and has weathered the grit, grime, grease, oil, coal dust, and soakings by rain and the odd accidental soaking in a swimming pool, so I can tell you, one train-lover to another, this thing's been battle-tested and is still going strong. I've put a railroad patch on the front and a pin or two in the brim, but otherwise I've made no alterations to it whatsoever, still just as good as the day I bought it.<br /><br />I do like the fact that it's machine washable, makes cleaning it up and getting it nice-looking again so much easier, although you can't really machine dry it too, otherwise it could shrink (put it over a coffee can and let it air dry, lads). I also like how the striped pattern isn't cutesy or cartoony like some engineer's caps out there, it looks just like the hats trainmen have worn for decades, which is a huge bonus for me, for I like to have an authentic-looking cap.<br /><br />Indeed, I've had several people come up to me and ask where I've gotten it from, for they usually think it is an antique cap I got handed down or something like that. At the very least,I get complemented &#34;Nice Hat&#34; every now and again, and that's always nice, and I've worn mine so much, people will always ask, &#34;Hey, where's your hat?&#34; whenever they see me without it, so I guess it's a trademark of sorts for me too.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased to have gotten this hat, and I'd recommend it to anybody else who wants a good engineer's hat, just for fun or for going out to work the &#34;High Iron&#34;.",2014-03-06

Now RICH folks can just send it to a hat shop in NY CITY. Then I remembered that I am an American and examined things more closely. I took a section of duct tape and stuck 3x 1ft. lengths of yarn on the sticky side and rolled it up sticky side out. Pull your hat band down so you can see the stitching and install like a bike tube. Remove front and back section with scissors, cut enough off back sides to fit. Don't in anyway feel that this is proof of the dumbing down of America, just prey 4 US.",2015-01-29

It would be suitable for cold weather activities such as skiing/snowboarding where wicking of the sweat can be crucial in keeping warm particularly in very cold conditions. But then again, whoever heard of anyone getting a frostbite on their ass? So it may make more sense to wear these during summer months during activities such as tennis and soccer?<br /><br />I am a BIG believer in synthetic outerwear. Advances in synthetic garment technology, such as gore-tex and new types of polyester, have enabled to create shirts, jackets, pants, gloves, shoes etc that can wick moisture, last longer, and even be more comfortable than traditional wool/cotton blends.<br /><br />Still, synthetic garments are not QUITE as comfortable as cotton on the skin. So these undergarments felt a little coarse to me (but definitely wearable). I prefer a blend of cotton/synthetic undergarments.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Wicks moisture better than Cotton and wool (maybe even silk).<br />2)Very tough.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)A little coarse.<br />2)Fairly expensive.",2013-01-01

It just lacks shape and quality - however it was not expensive, so you really get what you pay for. I do find it hard to believe that a TRUE woman;s size TEN will be able to fit into this. I wear a size 4 in woman's and this is closer to maybe an 8 or even a larger 6. I do not think that a size ten will be able to finagle this for a correct fit. DOUBLE check your size BEFORE hitting the buy button, because you won't like the size if they do not make at least a size larger for you.

Before I've had various remotes, either for presentations or for multi-media, but invariably the remote is not with me at the moment I need it.  This remote fits in the slot in the side of your computer and then is always with you.  HUGE advantage to this remote!  Plug & Play always worked on any computers I tried it on (XP & Vista [blech] & Win7, all 32-bit).  Buttons are responsive, etc.  Never any problems.  A few small issues that could be called \\""cons\\"":  * holding this remote (about the size and shape of 2-3 credit cards stacked on top of each other) is not nearly as satisfying of an experience as holding something that fits more comfortable in your hand.  Definitely not a big deal, but something to bear in mind if you do presentations a lot.  * PCMCIA & Express slots seem to be gradually becoming a thing of the past.  It's been years since I used these slots for what they are made for, but I really am sad that with my new computer I don't have a place to store my Mobile Edge presenter anymore...  Anyway, make sure your laptop has a slot that fits this remote before buying...  * Because the remote is being stored inside your computer, when someone steals your computer you also lose your remote.  On a distantly related note, be careful where you park your car if you ever visit Bari, Italy -- I have it on good authority [mine!] that car break-ins are all too common there.  And if you want to make a donation to the replacement-computer-fund I'd be happy to accept... :-)  Having said \\""be sure you have a slot\\"" I should hasten to add that I'm not sure any other remote offers the same broad functionality that this one does with both the presenter & the media capabilities.  So even if you don't have a slot this may be the remote you are looking for...  I strongly recommend this product.",2011-11-23

This bra passes the jumping jack test as well as the running test with flying colors. I quite forget that I even have boobs when I'm wearing this bra, there is so little jiggling discomfort.

Previamente, hace unos años cuando estaba en el colegio, mis padres me habían regalado un Citizen, luego un Casio, los cuales no duraron mucho tiempo funcionando, y por último me compré un Swatch de carátula azul y marco de aluminio que me duró varios años. Fue hasta ese momento que descubrí la importancia de comprar un reloj de mayor calidad que los que usaba desde joven. El atractivo para mí siempre ha sido lo brillante, pero también el precio. Y fue por eso que decidí usar este modelo nuevo de Swatch, el elegante Swatch Diaphane Chronograph .   Tiene el tamaño perfecto que se ajusta a mi muñeca, a diferencia del modelo Swatch Wealthy Star, cuyo diseño debo aceptar que me gustó mas, pero el tamaño es exagerado en mi antebrazo, tanto que más que llamativo parece grotezco.   El modelo Diaphane además, se puede elegir en varios colores, así que cada quien puede elegir el que más lo identifique.   El único defecto es su carátula, porque se raya con los golpes, pero en los stands de Swatch los pulen sin costo adicional.  Lo recomiendo un 100%.",2010-04-03

It's not something I would need to work in every day or for sub-zero weather.  I just wanted something decent that was breathable since it's easy to go from cold to hot once you start sweating.  I recently got a mid and expedition crew for what I assume was some kind of winter clearance since the price was marked down considerably.  Since the cold weather is behind us I haven't really put them to the test.  However, we have had a couple of cold days recently in the mid-atlantic so I decided to at least test them for size and to see how they performed in cool weather.<br /><br />When you try it on it feels like any other tight fitting long sleeve t-shirt.  I'm 5'11' and about 185 lbs with an athletic build, and an XL was pretty comfortable.  One thing I did notice, which other reviewers have commented on, was that the sleeves are definitely a bit short.  One of the reasons I picked XL over L was because I wanted to increase my odds of not having this happen. I'm guessing it is by design, but it's a little annoying to me.  Not a big deal when you're wearing it under something else, but less than ideal when you're wearing just the shirt alone.",2014-04-17

I have been wanting a olive green military/anorak/jacket for about 3.5 years now and have looked online for the perfect one EVERYWHERE. My hopes were getting dashed, every one had an element that just wasn't right, too expensive, black leather sleeves, cheap metal, cheap looking in general, no hood, too short, too long...you get the picture. But this one, this jacket looked perfect. Then I got it, and put it on, and it was love.<br /><br />I was afraid it would be too small in the shoulders as people were saying the fit was a bit tight. I'm 5'3&#34; roughly 138 lbs and I got a small, it fits perfectly!<br /><br />My fave elements about this jacket:<br />+Detachable hood.<br />+Soft, quality looking fabric.<br />+Nice green color.<br />+Sturdy looking and nice quality metal findings.<br />+Draw strings, draw strings everywhere. What better to cinch that waist?<br />+Roll-able sleeves.<br />+Patch pockets, but they are actually side pockets too!

The only thing I don't really like is that the metal findings on the fish tail drawstring hit the back of my leg when I walk. I haven't figured out a good way to tie them to not do this. I saw a pinterest image once where they used the drawstring to tie it up the fishtail so it became a square back hem.

I run 20+ miles a week and do yoga twice per week and I wore this bra solely for running. Usually for yoga I just wear a champion compression bra, but I need something like this to hold me while I run. I'm not a very busty gal, but I realized I need something more. It was very hard for me to enjoy my runs because I felt I was \\""moving\\"" all over the place.  I tried to two and then three sports compression bras at once and it felt too tight on my abdomen and I had trouble breathing, and I was still \\""moving\\"".  Over time, I noticed that I was sore in the breast area, so I just decided to get a better sports bra.    That was a great decision. I bought this bra shown, and initially, I did love it. I didn't \\""move\\"" and my chest was comfortable enough to breathe. I wore this three times a week, and hand washed it in the sink and hung it to dry on my towel rack. Four months later, the back straps are unravelling where the hooks are and the bra is deteriorating in the breast area. I have never treated a bra nicer than I have treated this one, and it's breaking down.    I guess it's time to start shopping again.",2011-01-15

I have a 6 7/8 size head, shaved,  that grows to 7 if I let my hair grow out a bit for the winter.  This hat has the appearance of an oilskin or waxed hat, but it is not.  I was thinking of applying some wax to it, but I'll probably just get another hat for that purpose.  One negative about this hat is that the brim is not shaped by strong wire.  The brim will constantly move on you if you lay your hat down, put it in a bag, or lean back with the hat on.  For me this is a negative.  I like to shape my hat once, and then have it stay in place.  With the thin, bendable gauge of wire that keeps the brim in shape, you will have to re shape often.

But onto the review, it's a soft canvas belt with structural integrity, it won't cut into you that bad, I replaced a leather belt with this because of that, when laying down with a hard belt they tend to dig into you.    I used this to carry a heavy baton, a solid colt pistol, radio, handcuffs and some tools just in case.  I did this all day in extremely abusive conditions and all hardware on the belt still looks as good as new.   Once you put the belt through the hole in the buckle to undo it pull on the belt and the little bolts will release, just make sure you hold them or it will lock again.    Very easy on and off, and works really well with medium loads of equipment, it's stitched together really well and looks like it will take a nice beating without any damage in the long run.     It also does not scratch that easy, and shines well \\""the buckle hardware\\"".

It did take a few weeks to arrive with no tracking so you never really know where it is.  When it finally did arrive I did not really open it up and looked it over, just wrapped it.  Well when it finally was opened it was a bit embarrassing.  The coats fabric as with many other reviews I read now has a really cheap fleece bathrobe feel to it and even comes with a bathrobe belt.  It is definitely a knockoff of the original picture which by the other reviews is a coat made by Victoria's Secret.  You need to look at all of the pictures because if you look at just the color you want you may not notice there are buttons going down the back of the coat.  Two of the buttons on my coat were missing.  Seller was responsive and believed me after I sent them pictures.  I wanted a refund, they wanted to give me $10 and send me to a tailor with the new buttons they were going to send me.  Definitely not worth the time for this coat.  Not worth the money I paid for it even though it is priced really cheap.  You WILL be getting what you pay for and maybe even a little less.<br /><br />As for size, I would definitely order a size larger than you normally wear.  The person I bought it for normally wears a medium however it did fit around here and was a little snug, the arms were waayyy too short and only came down to about 5&#34; above her wrist.<br /><br />I would not recommend you purchase this from my experience.",2014-12-11

The hood is ginormous, and even dwarfs my massive melon. The sleeves are oceans of fabric that hang long, loose, and free. Other reviews have mentioned, and I will confirm, that the robe is incredibly long. I am only 5'10\\"", and I have approximately three extra inches of robe that trail the floor. This is a very simple fix, and can be taken care of with scissors, or fold the extra up and create a hem. The fabric itself is thick and heavy, with rather durable stitching inside. The quality of the fabric itself is very nice, it's actually soft, warm, and rather comfy, perhaps on par with a comfy sweatshirt sort of feeling. That said, like a sweatshirt, it is rather warm. I do not perceive myself wearing it anywhere that I wouldn't wear a jacket. If you think a place is so warm that you would eventually be removing a jacket, then likely you will eventually be removing this robe. It's not a flaw in the product so much as a side effect of the thick material. If you plan on taking little ones trick or treating in the cool weather of autumn, this robe will certainly keep you warm, and it will look great doing it!",2013-10-18

I buy fitted dress shirts as follows: 16&#34; neck, 43&#34; chest, 38.5&#34; stomach. So not a &#34;V&#34; but close.

This is my size. If I had old-school body-builder arms/chest, XXL might be better. If I wanted the tight look or had no muscle definition, I *might* could pull it off with a medium without looking stupid. This is a good shirt, strong quality, lots of compliments. If it's the wrong size the first time, suck it up- that's why they're cheap.<br /><br />The problem is that this shirt's color is off from what you see.

Comfortable, Cute, and Practical!","So...I guess I am truly a mom in my thirties because I had no idea this product existed, but when I found it, I was like, &#34;YES. YES. I WOULD LIKE A PAIR OF PANTS I CAN WEAR IN THE WATER. Oh? You can add a skirt on top of the pants? PANTS AND A SKIRT THAT COVER EVERYTHING? Sign me up. Sign me the frick up.&#34;<br /><br />I was going to the beach for Spring Break with my in-laws, and I hadn't lost the baby weight. Or, the baby-before-that weight. When I was younger, I would have worked out and dieted (and stressed) for weeks before a vacation like this... and then I would have probably looked relatively thin and worn a relatively skimpy suit.<br /><br />Honey, I barely have time to shower now, much less worry about the state of my thighs. So when I realized they make swim capris, I was excited. I was leaving for vacation in three days and hadn't had time to shop or do anything, so the fact that this was an Amazon Prime item -- and returnable, though God knows I hope if you return this you wore underwear underneath? Do they resell returned swim items? Urgh. I hope not -- anyway, it wasn't an issue for me. I loved it! I remember some reviews saying that the waistline was loose/not fitted. I just took a chance and ordered a medium.<br /><br />It arrived in two days. The fabric is super-lightweight and soft. I tried it on (yes, over underwear) and it was SOOOOO comfortable I didn't want to take it off. The capri/pants portion was fitted but not super-tight -- very easy to pull on and off. The skirt was loose but fitted around my butt (my husband liked it)...the skirt is VERY short, but I mean, it covers your *ss AND you're wearing pants. Unless you're Michele Duggar I don't think you'll be self-conscious. It wasn't super-tight around the waistband, but since I still have a post-baby pouch, it was fine for me. There's a thin sort of lining, kind of like those no-stick headbands they sell now? It was very comfortable and I LOVED it. Seriously, if it hadn't been -10 degrees outside, I would have worn it all day.<br /><br />Of course, the real test was wearing it in the water -- worked great! On days when it was cool, this actually kept me warm in the water, which was something I didn't expect. And when you get out, it dries pretty quickly, too.<br /><br />Overall, this was a super-comfortable, super-practical, super-cute item perfect for vacationing with the in-laws and little kids. It let me be active, feel cute, yet not have to stress about my body -- which really, who has the time and energy for that? The only con I would say is the price -- but I will try to take care of this and hope it lasts a long time. It feels worth it right now!",2015-04-09

But after clicking around Amazon and other places for a while, I couldn't find a cheaper alternative quality braided belt (ordering and returning a couple other choices that ended up being junk) that was actually a real braided belt that allowed creation of any size rather than having pre-set holes like a regular belt.  This belt is worth the extra money.  Very nice quality, looks quite good, allows custom sizing by sticking the prong anywhere along the length with (so far at least) no signs of wear on the belt from plugging in holes in various places.  Warning on size: buy your actual waist size.  Usually it seems that belt sizes are not accurate, and you need a bigger quoted belt size relative to your waist size, and that's what Trafalgar actually recommends on their web site.

Great deal! I got it sooner than expected and it fit great!<br /><br />I'm a slim athletic build and V shape torso. She based my size on the measurements listed on the sizing chart. It's fairly accurate. If you fit in the medium, and you're right at the top, it will fit like a fitted shirt not that baggy stuff a lot of people are used to. USE THE SIZING CHART.  Girls, if you're ordering for your man don't just believe him that he's a large. That means get your measurements. The cut of this jacket is slimmer than most.<br /><br />The material is not stiff.  It's basically a dressy sweatshirt hoodie.<br />For me, it's a little baggy in the mid-section, but it fits me perfectly otherwise. It's very warm for a sweatshirt because of the double breasted front, and the hood is actually big enough to put on. Sometimes these Asian-made jackets have tiny little hoods, but that's not the case here. It's average. Someone complained about snapping all those buttons, to which I say, How long is a New York minute?  Longer than it takes you to snap those buttons, and WAY shorter than a SoCal minute.<br /><br />CONS: I got a red one. The bands around the cuffs and bottom are different fabric than the body. This means that as it is washed and worn, the two fabrics may fade differently. *Will update in future.<br />Also, this looks a lot like a regular hoodie from the back. If you're wearing it with nicer clothes, it will dress you down A LOT.  I've decided that adding darts to the back will dress it up a little bit.  PLUS, it will make it noticeably more fitted.<br /><br />VERDICT:<br />If you think you like it, buy it!",2014-04-15

I am in introvert and rarely leave home. When I take my wife to the store, I stay inside my van and avoid making eye contact with other people walking by. This beard and wig set has changed my life! I put it on before pulling out of the driveway and keep it on till we get home. At first my wife was not all that happy about the wig and beard but after she saw how wearing it changed my life she puts up with it. Now when I pull up to a stoplight people beside me don't look at me with contempt like they used to, I can see the fear in their eyes as I glare down at them before finally putting them at ease by smiling with my Billy Bob teeth (a product that should be considered if you buy the wig and beard set). When I used to go down the aisle in the big box store in my wheelchair people would rudely stand in my way but now their eyes bug out and they jump back like they think I have Ebola or something. The only bad thing about this set is that from my back people can tell it is not my natural hair. You need a coarse hairbrush to blend in the beard with the wig and make it look natural. Yes, I cannot think of any product I have ever purchased that, for the money, has made me as happy as the caveman beard and wig set. I just wish I had found this beard and wig 20 years ago!",2014-11-27

I had read all of the comments from others that they were not necessarily easy to mold to the teeth so I waited until I had time to work with them and would not be hurried.  I spent 60 minutes working with the adhesive material; heating it up putting it on the tooth; trying to position it, molding it properly and then trimming the mold.  I used a mirror and spent time reheating and reshaping material over and over. It was not an easy process.  I first tried the amount of adhesive material that was recommended, then less, then more.  It didn't really matter, the material always globbed over my other teeth and did not look at all natural.  I finally got one tooth to look right and fit properly.  I started with the other tooth and had similar problems to the first tooth.  After another 30 minutes the tip of that tooth eventually melted from the heat of the adhesive and I had to throw everything out.  What a waste of money.  Fortunately I found an old set that I had used a few years ago and the mold to my teeth was still intact.  I will not purchase this particular type of custom vampire fangs again.  The set that I found were also Sexy Bites.  They had come with an adhesive powder and liquid.  Yes, I recall an unpleasant taste when I first worked with them to mold to my mouth but it was much easier to do and they held up well over a few years storage.  From my experience, Sexy Bites products are worth trying, but this specific adhesive method was not for me.",2013-11-07

We got it all laced up and it's awesome, really. The problem is my body. I'm 5'9&#34; but i have a long torso more than long legs (which is why I go for the highest heels I can find). I am 15&1/2 inches from center sternum to navel. This corset lays just above my navel at about 14 in. This wouldn't be an issue if I were still 18 with a flat stomach, no kids, and perkier breasts. But, alas, I got out out of the army, had kids, got fat..I'm working on it... I weigh 223 and I don't think even THAT would be an issue if my torso were shorter but I have the dreaded mother's apron! I had three C sections...all breach babies...and that did some serious damage to my tummy. This corset, because of where it falls, pushes that roll of stretch marked skin right out the bottom and is wildly unflattering. I'm in a size 12-14 now down from a size 20-22 (50lbs) since November. I think if I lose another 20 lbs and hit my core hard, I'll fit into this nicely. But it's just too short to pull down, because it becomes an under bust in a very weird way.... And I tried to stuff it with that loose skin but it didn't really work....I tried a tummy tamer with it and no dice. If you are long in the torso and mushy around the middle, try a longer corset or an under bust...or buy this and hang this beautiful well made (albeit up close you can tell the leather is plastic) corset near your elliptical machine and work your way into it!",2015-05-07

I'll be sure to post a review after I get the smaller pair! *UPDATE* Got the smaller pair, I ordered a Medium, and they are MUCH better! They fit great, and they are the right length.

Also, for skinny jeans, it seems odd that they have that extra material at the ankle.  It might make it uncomfortable to wear inside boots.

As soon as it arrived (well packaged, clean, no wrinkles, no loose beads in the box), I measured it on a yard stick.<br /><br />The color is a match to what I see on screen.  Reading reviews that complain of loose beads...I can see right away where I'm going to have problems on fringe...they are inconsistently secured to the fringe...some are hanging on one or two threads with the fabric knotting somewhat above the string itself, while other strings are completely wrapped/protected by the fabric itself.  I surmise that regular and normal wear would eventually cause issues, particularly if used frequently with the clip.<br /><br />As for the bleeding, being forewarned from other posters (and being stuck without the ability to return the item because I needed/purchased it for an outing the same period it was delivered), I simply handwashed item three times...all with a small white baby's tee...just to see what it would pick up...absolutely no color transfer.",2014-06-28

I'm planning on wearing it when I go visit my friend at her college for Halloween. It arrived quickly and was neatly packaged. There were no rips or stains on it (both of which I've had happen when ordering clothing items online). The onesie itself fits pretty well (I'm 5'2) it hangs a bit loosely on me, but from what I've read in reviews, and seen in pictures, that's what it's supposed to do. It's super soft and warm. I overheat pretty easily, but I know this will be appreciated if I end up wearing it on a cold night. It has a hood and wings, which were my favorite parts. It also has little mittens on the hands but you can slip them off if you don't want them. Oh and I should mention that while I love this, my birds do not.

Unfortunately the dress just did not work for me, though it is a very pretty dress and would probably work much better for someone with different proportions. The dress is in two pieces. One piece is the seafoam lace under-dress. Very pretty color. As mentioned - top is completely sheer lace (which I was excited about - I love wearing sheer tops with pretty, lacey bralettes). There's an elastic waist (which is hard to see in the pics). The bottom half is lined with a nude slip-like fabric, though the lace hangs a tad bit lower than the lining for a pretty hem effect. This lace dress was pretty, but not the greatest quality. Not terrible, but probably Forever 21 level. It will wear fine if worn rarely and with care, but this isn't the type of quality that will hold up for ages. The second part is the crocheted vest-like part. The crocheted seemed of a better quality than the lace part of the dress.<br /><br />My problem was the proportions. I'm fairly tall (5'9&#34;) so the elastic waist hit me a tad bit under the bust (upper ribcage I guess). From there it just hung like an empire waist dress (with almost a gathering/pleat like effect). The vest covered the waist but it still look fairly obvious to me. I'm also somewhat pear shaped - small in the waist, large in the hips, so it just wasn't flattering on me. I think the dress would provide the effect shown in the picture on someone who was average height or short and with narrower hips. On me - it looked more like a 70's grandma sundress rather than the 20's vibe I got from the images.",2015-01-30

But Tight in the Shoulders When Arms are Raised,"[[VIDEOID:616f26452974297a73c50a0c2b07b856]]I really like the shirt... but the shoulders are tight.  Six foot, 175 pounds, and I never considered myself having broad shoulders.  What makes it odd is that the torso fit is perfect.  I mean, bang-on form fit around the chest, even buttoned up.  Just when I raise my arms up, the shoulder cut tugs and causes the sleeves to bunch up quite a bit.  However, I have somewhat stopped noticing the tugging with regular wear.<br /><br />Still, I wish I had gone the XL just for more freedom in the shoulders (even though would have made the chest fit a little baggy).  It has gone through the wash without any noticeable shrinkage.  The front \\""pocket\\"" isn't a pocket, but an accent.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.",2015-07-26

When she tried them on, the length was just right, meaning no room to grow at all, also meaning I will need to buy another pair within a month if she has a growth spurt. The biggest reason for 3 stars is that she complained about the waist band in the back where the seam meets. It's very rough and scratchy for a small child's soft skin. I can see she probably won't last long in them and complain about how much they bother her. Therefore, I have bought a different brand hoping the seem in the back is less rough.

I have never owned a pair of jeans that shrunk from just washing on cold before, and I am pretty bummed out, as I liked them a lot prior.

The material that is used for this skirt is a poly/cotton blend (35/65 respectively) so it has some give to it.  You'll see in my photos that despite me wearing a slip under it, it still pulls a bit here and there but that's mostly due to the zipper not wanting to lay flat.  That's where the long top comes in - just to hide the zipper bump.<br /><br />The material is thin, almost a jersey knit.  It is not thin enough to see through though so a slip isn't necessary - I put one on in an attempt to remedy the zipper issue, but the slip didn't do anything to help that.  I'm confident this skirt will grow to be one of my favorite spring-fall skirts.  The taupe is a beautiful shade and it is very comfortable to wear.  I dressed mine down today with a T-shirt, zippered hoodie, and a pair of chucks.  I got so many compliments on the skirt while I had it dressed down.<br /><br />I'm taking it to my tailor to see what we can come up with to keep that zipper flat, but otherwise, this pencil skirt (my first ever!) is going to be a mainstay in my wardrobe.<br /><br />I did receive a discount on this skirt in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  That discount has obviously not swayed my opinion of the skirt.<br />**I will update after I meet with my tailor to share the plan of attack on that zipper if anyone else is having that same issue.  That small issue isn't enough for me to want to return the skirt - it's fixable and for all I know, it could be my curves.<br /><br />4/5 for fit, versatility, spot on color.  I did mark down the one star for the zipper issue.  If my tailor says my body shape is to blame for that, I'll promptly amend my review and star assessment.",2015-04-17

After tying these on, I realized they advertised as 40 inch dress length when in actuality they're about 34 inch length, judging by the pants I've worn (32x32-32x36). That said, the length is just fine.<br /><br />I'm 6'2&#34; @ 150 lbs. I have a 30-32 inch waist, and not only do these fit me perfectly, but they are now the most comfortable pants I own! The length could be a couple inches longer, sure. But as they are, they do well to not be ruined by dragging on the ground or beneath your feet as you walk. I also tend to wear my pants a bit low, along the hip / three or so inches below my belly button.<br /><br />After trying these on, I immediately purchased their other unisex styles. They're quite unique, nobody else has them, and they may look silly if you don't have a complimentary ensemble to &#34;pull them off&#34; - but once you feel their comfort and style, pulling them off is secondary to just putting them on.",2015-05-20

Great . . . all by itself!,"I had recently tried Love Fifi's `Open All Night Crotchless Panty' - and loved it - so I'd thought I'd give another crotchless g-string of theirs a try.    Whereas the `Open All Night Crotchless Panty' was perfect for wearing under my clothes -- the `Fairy Dust Crotchless G-String' with its pretty sequined ruffle - seemed intended for other uses.    Like many women, I've found that g-strings are a great way to show off one's derriere - and a fun way to create a little excitement when undressing.  (Nothing says `make love to me' as quickly, for example - when peeling out of tight jeans, right?)      And crotchless panties are a cute (and mentally intoxicating) way to be sexy - to just that one person - very discretely.  (Although it could be argued - that wearing any crotchless undie - underneath one's skirt in public is hardly discreet . . .)    So the combination of the two (g-string + crotchless) should be almost atomic powered, right?  Well, not quite.  Here's what I discovered:    First off, I ended up using this item in the bedroom - either with a matching black teddy (the shorter, the better) - or all by itself.  (In the latter case, if I wanted any additional coverage - I'd use my arms.  Get it?)    Second, because this panty isn't obviously crotchless - I found myself announcing this feature early on - to maintain the tease (and get his attention) until the crotchless feature was fully revealed.    When viewed normally, the low-rise front of the panty - somewhat hides the start of the crotchless feature down between your legs.  And the double string crotchless nature of the panty's back - is somewhat hidden (by your cheeks), especially since the two strings still meet at a singular point (at the waist) and follow the groove . . . of your you-know-what!    Now, don't laugh - but when I tried these crotchless undies on - and spread my legs, I found that the separation didn't improve very much (again due to the common attachment point for the dual strings).It took a bit of experimenting (and again, please don't laugh) - but I found that these knickers are sexiest - when viewed from the rear - with knees straight (and bent over at the waist - and holding one's ankles).  From this view, the crotchless feature is nicely visible - with the strings traversing on either side (rather than bisecting annoyingly up the middle).      The third (and last) bit of learning - was that these panties were great when putting on a performance for my guy, especially when dancing with my rear facing him - very closely -- or when straddling him in a sixty-nine sort of fashion (while he's either in a chair or on the bed).   At those times - the view was unbeatable (and his expression, when I looked back - was priceless!).    For actual encounters, the crotchless feature really didn't make entry any easier.  According to my guy, pulling a normal g-string aside -- isn't that difficult.  And the two strings of this crotchless version were sometimes as apt to get in the way - as one (string).  But, hey!  It's the thought that counts, right?    To conclude, this Fairy Dust Crotchless G-String from Love Fifi -- is great alone - or under a sexy teddy.  And nothing you can wear - will give your guy a more enticing - and intimate rear view!  Enjoy.",2007-11-04

But these are excellent quality socks that have held up well through heavy use and lots of washings. The three pair are serving well alongside their far more expensive drawer-mates. It's hard to imagine someone getting excited by a pair of socks, but these are worth getting excited about. I agree that a color other than gray would help to stretch these socks further in my wardrobe, but for the price... I ain't complainin'!",2004-09-19

I'm 5'3&#34; and 123 pounds with what I would consider an hourglass figure, and this fit wonderully. With my height and shortish torso, it isn't a perfect fit, but it still works. It bunches a little bit around the waist because of the short torso, but the red sash around the waist covers that with not problems. The legs are a little long on me, but that will be covered with the boots I'm going to wear. I do wish the legs would've had stirrups, though. That would've helped to keep the legs in place. However, those are small things.<br /><br />A little word of warning, this is a very fitted, figure hugging costume that hugs every curve of your body. It will show everything. On the bright side, it isn't see-through. I would recommend using some double sided tape in the bust area to keep everything in place, though. Also, definitely wear heels in this costume since that little extra lift helps to make the legs and butt look more toned and creates a much sexier ninja!<br /><br />I had to take one star off for two reasons:<br />1) The mask that covers your mouth and nose doesn't fit well. It rides up and hits my eyes a bit, but that's okay since I doubt I'll be wearing it all night anyways.<br />2) The straps that wrap around your legs slip down constantly. I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to remedy this. I think that a safety pin would snag and damage the costume and a little dab of glue with also ruin the costume. I'm hoping that some double sided tape will do the trick.",2014-10-10

It definitely is true to size, but you gotta know your size in Juniors clothing.  Shows a lot of leg- for people like me that don't have \\""girls\\"" to catch people's attention!  The rosette flower on the \\""belt\\"" is nice and thick, and is made from sturdy material.  The pleats were in great condition when it came in. I didn't have to dry clean it as soon as I got it!  The dress flares out very nicely.  If you think it looks \\""too young\\"" you can easily pluck off the flower and then pair with leggings and a blazer.    CONS:  The \\""belt\\"" is Navy, not Black.  It is really short, so if you're tall like me (over 5'9\\"") then you might want to wear leggings.  The zipper is a little tough to pull past the \\""belt\\"" but once you're past that then it's just fine.  It has to be dry cleaned.    Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend this dress, and I would also buy more. :)",2011-09-06

It is an excellent fit and is VERY warm.  It is well made and looks more expensive than what I paid for it.  The only issue I had with it was that it took over three weeks to receive.  I wasn't aware that this was going to be made and shipped from China.  The package as well as the tag on the jacket are written in Chinese. The other odd thing is that the jacket came in a medium,  instead of an XS that I ordered, even though I believe it is actually an extra small, at least in comparison to clothing sizes in the U.S.  There is no possible way that anyone wearing an medium, at least to U.S. standards would ever be able to fit in it.  Being that most asian women are smaller, I assume their idea of what a medium is in comparison to what we wear is most likely different.  If it were any smaller on me, I would have had to return it.

I measure at a 30 band so I figured this would be perfect. In fit, it fit perfectly; no gapping, the center rested on my sternum, and it stayed up through a bunch of jumping around (the only true strapless test).<br /><br />The only problem (and the reason I returned it) was the shape of the cups. Now I do understand this may have had to do with this being so new and never broken in or tried on, but I have worked in lingerie before and my time there taught me that wash and wear can only change this shape so much. It was too pointy, like the tips of party hats got strapped onto a band and called a strapless bra. The Torpedo Boob effect is not my style, I prefer a more round natural shape, and I did not get that in this product.<br /><br />The push-up padding in the bra is just about the lightest level of push available. It lifts a little, but doesn't really change the shape of the cleavage or create much cleavage at all.<br /><br />The beige of this bra was wonderful though; it is not a white based beige, but rather a more warm tan that works well with more golden skin tones.",2014-07-01

I think you have to hand wash it.  The material does feel a bit cheap and very thin.  But, it was cheap ($9.50), so I got what I paid for.

The trench coat was stuffed into a 12&#34;x12&#34;x2&#34; box and had wrinkles all over when I took it out. The image provided makes it appear as if the coat is a light taupe color when in reality it is more of a light olive drab, which I was actually pleasantly surprised by. The coat feels pretty sturdy; it's got some weight to it even without a lining. The buttons seem to be sewn on well.<br /><br />Here's the thing: I'm 5'6&#34; and I ordered it in 40 Short thinking it would fit like all the other long coats I buy. I can wear it over a suit jacket and button everything just fine. However, this trench coat has a VERY generous length, falling at about five inches below my knee cap. I'm not a big fan of the look as it makes me feel like a kid wearing his dad's coat. If you're around my height you might wanna go for the Extra Short option.

52172373,R1TTBI8LTRD420,B001GJLTMW,997893274,Scala Classico Men's Crushable Felt Outback Hat,Apparel,5.0,0.0,1.0,N,Y,I've never been a hat person . . .,"but this hat has changed me into one.  Due to a steady abandonment of my hair from my head, I discovered that cold air is now tingling my scalp.  &#34;Sooner or later,&#34; I thought, &#34;I'm gonna have to get a hat.&#34;  Not being a big fan of baseball caps, I considered the flat cap but didn't like the looks.  The cowboy hat was just too limited on where I could wear it without looking like a dork.  So, I started looking at hats when I happened to see them in stores but didn't go out of my way searching.<br /><br />While browsing in a local department store while my wife was Christmas shopping I ran across this hat.  It felt great, fit perfectly, looked good on me and was a good color!  I also LOVED the fact that it was crushable and would pop right back out to normal and was nearly waterproof!  What was NOT to like was the price!  In the store this hat was $90!  WOW!  For me that was too much for a first hat!!  &#34;I can beat that on Amazon,&#34;  I told myself.<br /><br />I jotted down the brand name, the model and size (L) and placed the order when I got home.  A few days later, my prize arrived and at a SIGNIFICANT savings!!  Unfortunately my bargain was too large!  It dropped to my ears and would not stay on my head.  I was Soooo disappointed!<br /><br />Now the debate was . . . which one was wrong?  The one in the department store or the one from Amazon?  I took a gamble and sent back the Amazon model (the only one at the department store one was sold) and reordered a medium.  I was disappointed to discover that for an unexplained reason, the medium was nearly $10 MORE than a large ?????<br /><br />Bottom line, the medium arrived and it fit great!  I love the hat!  My head stays warm, it sheds water and I've gotten lots of compliments on its looks.  It is appropriate in most venues and has a classic look without being pretentious.<br /><br />The journey was a bit frustrating but it was well worth it!",2014-01-03

The fabric is 65% polyester/35% cotton, has lots of body and a nice &#34;hand&#34;, and washes up with minimal wrinkling.  Each of the colors has piping at the neckline, an interior pocket, and a waist tie in a complimentary shade; too pretty.  The stitching and consistency of fit are great.  I need to look into this company, because I don't know how you can buy all this for $9.99 per garment unless they're made by sweatshop labor.  (The tag says they're made in China.)<br /><br />A couple of minor &#34;cons&#34;:  The interior pocket on the right is not as deep as the two main patch pockets, and for some inexplicable reason my hand seems to go right into that one first, which is a little annoying.  Also, the right pocket  has a bit of stitching to keep a pen in place, should you be in the habit.  That's a nice detail, but the stitching is on the bellybutton side of the pocket rather than on the hip side, so sooner or later you'll discover that there are times when your pen jabs you in the abdomen.  I just took a seam-ripper to them and got rid of that problem.<br /><br />So--sweatshop labor?  Do we buy these anyway?  I'll have to look into it.  In the meantime, these are finely-made shirts, functional, and handsome.",2014-10-05

Its a beautiful dress that comes all the way from China, so be warned returns will cost you a pretty penny at the post office. The dress although lovely is MADE FOR PETITE WOMEN ONLY, id say the average american teenage girl at best (Not exaggerating). The XXL came in and i was hoping the dress would fall over my hips nicely as it does in the picture, but unfortunately it puffs out making my hips look bigger than they are and not at all in a  flattering way. The middle part of the dress is covering part of my breasts partially so that really throws off the whole look of it to begin with. It is also tight on the arms and I am too embarrassed to wear it.If you are a petite woman this dress will most likely look great on you, its just as beautiful as in the photo, but if you are curvy (have over a B cup in chest size) and have big hips, & a butt it may not be the dress for you.

The t-shirt definitely fits well and the thin fabric really contours the top of your body(shoulders, arms, chest), while still remaining loose and free. But the best part is that the sleeves are *long and narrow*! I can't believe how many companies don't understand this simple aspect. I see so many of these ugly wide sleeves that flap around or are too short and stick out, it's ridiculous. Not so with these Volcoms(though not all their tees are well shaped). Only drawbacks here are the printed designs(who needs them?) and that the bottom is a bit longish for an athletic fit, but that depends on body type. I'm happy with the purchase overall.",2011-10-02

When they send the product to you it is actually large. Then when you complain they sent the wrong size, they refuse to return it, telling you you should give it to your friend as a gift. They make some excuse that it is based on Chinese sizes, so large in Chinese sizes is actually XS in US sizes. But the whole thing is mis advertized and their return policy is terrible, so you basically don't know what size you are getting. This a typical online SCAM that you want to avoid. Strongly recommend Amazon to drop this seller. First and last time I will ever use this company. Also, the quality of the material is extremely poor, color is not burgundy and not like the picture.

The only problem with white is that when you are on the road wearing gray jerseys it clashes a bit.  So having another color just looks better.  I suppose if you are a Detroit Tigers fan you can wear this at home games at Comerica Park and it would be okay.  On the other hand, it could motivate you to take a drive to another American League Central city to see the Tigers play.  There is much to be said for a Major League Baseball road trip.<br /><br />But such a trip could be justified because Tigers fans are starting to feel a lot better about their young team.  A couple of years ago the big question was whether they would lose more games than any team in baseball history.  For 2005 the big question is whether they can improve as much as they did last year when they went 72-90 and finished 4th in the American League Central division.  Manager Alan Trammell is in his third season and starting to build on the foundation that is being put together in Detroit.  Having brought in Pudge Rodriguez (.334, 19 home runs, 89 runs batted in) to catch and steady the young pitching staff, this past winter the Tigers added Magglio Ordo&ntilde;ez (.292, 9, 37) and closer Troy Percival (2.90, 33 saves).  Ordo&ntilde;ez needs to bounce back to All-Star status and Percival needs to prove he has not lost too much off of his fastball, but if that happens the Tigers can aim for breaking even on their record and finishing third in the division.  You keep improving one place in the standings each year and in a couple of years you can win the division.<br /><br />Trammell is trying to build on the same bedrock keystone combination that the Tigers had when he was playing opposite Lou Whitaker.  Carlos Guillen (.318, 20, 97) is the shortstop and Omar Infante (.264, 16, 55) plays second.  That means the entire infield reached double-figures in home runs with Brandon Inge at third (.287, 13, 64) and Carlos Pe&ntilde;a at first (.241, 27, 82).  For that matter, so did Rondell White (.270, 19, 67) and Craig Monroe (.293, 18, 72) in the outfield.  What it is going to come down to is how good the young starting rotation can be.  Jeremy Bonderman (11-13, 4.89) certainly looked like he was ready to be the ace of the staff on Opening Day, but they need him, Mike Maroth (11-13, 4.31) and Jason Johnson (8-15, 5.13) to join Nate Robertson (12-10, 4.90) as pitchers with winning records.  That probably means they are going to have to play a lot better when they are wearing the hats with the orange \\""D\\"" on the road.Lou Whitaker.

From meetings to working on trucks, these pants were resilient and great.

They are very stretchy and they never end up sagging at the end of the day. The bottom of the jean is not that skinny and I have to end up rolling and tucking into socks to wear with boots in winter. In summer I roll the bottoms up and make cute crop jeans with a cuff. I am not that happy with the way the jeans look by themselves but if you are willing to fold and tuck the rest of the jean fits nicely. I ordered both the soulful dark and the indigo sky washes on Amazon. If you notice in the details section these two washes have a different make up of cotton/polyester/elastane. The dark washes fit better imo.<br /><br />I usually wear a size 12 in pants but in these I can wear a 10 because they are so stretchy.<br /><br />I bought these pants in December 2013 and now in August 2014 they have developed some weird puckering on the inside seam at the front of the pant. I did put these jeans in the dryer so I think that's what caused the damage. It seems to be irreversible so beware these jeans won't last that long if you put them in the dryer regularly.,2014-08-09

The material is light but you can't see thru it unless you stand with a light behind you but I've had that issue with other dresses as well so that's not a big thing to me.  I wear it as a swimsuit cover up when company comes over for a pool party.  It comes off easily when I'm ready to take a dip and when I'm done I put it back on and then I've got plenty of room to take off my suit while wearing the cover up.

Exactly what I wanted. As far as looks go this would get 6 stars in my book. I just wish it would have been a little better made. I could tell, right out of the package that it was going to end up coming apart a little bit and unraveling. So disappointing! But I kept it anyways just because it is just so beautiful. So I wore it once and it was ok until I washed it...by hand, drip dry. The part I new was going to come apart did and there was some fraying. It wasn't terrible, so I went to the store and bought some liquid stitch and fray stop and did my best to fix it. It is basically fixed although I have not washed it again to see if there are any more problems. Hopefully not because I just love this dress so much. If they could step up the quality of these I would definitely pay even more and buy more in several colors. But as it is I feel it is over priced for what you are getting. As far as the fit goes, it fit great! I am 5'4&#34; with and average size and an apple body type (unfortunately). It is adjustable so I feel it would work for many different sizes and body types, except maybe not so much for the super skinny. If I had it to do all over again? I admit I would probably buy this dress again and suffer through fixing it and hoping it lasts just because it is that cute and I have yet to see anything else like it out there.",2015-07-17

It arrived quickly and well packaged.  It was pretty much as advertised.  The quality of the costume overall seemed pretty good, which I would assume it would be given the $40+ price tag.  However, there were some disappointments.  There was a spot where the stitching missed joining two panels together leaving a 1-2\\"" long opening right in the middle of the chest which clearly should have been caught.  I had to cut open the lining and hand stitch a repair.  Also several of the snaps came apart after the first fastening.  Again, I was able to re-crimp them with a pair of pliers.  Finally, the bottom of the zipper didn't have a plastic base but just a simple piece of thread holding the two sides together.  This stitch broke and the zipper started separating from the base.  Again about 20 minutes to fix.<br /><br />All this after the first trial fitting that only lasted about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Once I performed all the above repairs, I was quite happy with the costume.

I opted for the Small, and the shoulders and sleeves fit well, but the body of the coat is very loose.  I don't button it, but wrap it and tie the belt.

Convenient pockets for everything and material is top notch.  My biggest concern was that it would be hard to pick up because it doesn't have a handle but that has never been an issue.

I'm 173cm and 72kg with a fairly lean built. My chest measures 37 inches and I bought the small which is 34 - 36 inches. Unfortunately, the fit wasn't as snug as I thought and was a little baggy. As a consequence, the jacket also drooped off my shoulders a little.<br /><br />I also noticed that the tag on the jacket said &#34;US men - Small; US women - Medium; Asian - Large&#34;, which explained the size discrepancy as I'm an Asian. As there is no extra small and the shipping cost me quite a bit, I'll just stick with it.<br /><br />Bottom line: It is fairly affordable compared to other jackets and you get what you pay for.

So, I wind up with tight bands of ribbon wedged around each calf, which is very uncomfortable.

Plus there's a reason money belts are maybe out of cloth. When u sweat with this BOULDER under ur pants, it sticks to u like glue and its VERY UNCOMFORTABLE and chaf's ur skin. Best to wear this on the outside. Gave 2 stars cause its well made.....for an exterior addition to an Army belt. And that point u c in the front in the picture? Yep, it protrudes out the front of your pants just like the picture. The pointy triangle won't go flat!!!!",2012-12-16

It's cheap, but it will work for a few good runs. Here's the layout:<br /><br />Reference: I bought a large, and my measurements are:<br />Bust: 39 inches (c-cup). Waist: 35 inches.  Hips: 39 inches.  Height: 5'4\\"".  The costume fits snugly.<br /><br />The top:<br />You've probably read other reviews, and they all say the top is too short, and it is. I'm 5'4\\"" with a short torso, and it's still short. It doesn't matter if you're short or tall, with a long or short torso, the top will always be rather short because of the way it's cut. You have to pull the skirt up pretty high so that no skin peeks out between the skirt and the top. It's not terrible, but it's annoying. The top is a zip-up back, and the material is pretty stretchy, which is a plus.  The faux corset front is fragile, so DO NOT PULL ON THE STRINGS. I repeat: DO NOT PULL ON THE STRINGS. I decided to try to pull the strings just a little bit tighter so that it would look better in the front, and I pulled one of the eyelets off. I had to sew it back on-- like I said, it's cheap.<br /><br />The belt:<br />It's crap. The waist measurement (I got a large, and they described that as up to 31 inches), is for the belt, not the top. The belt has nothing to really hook in to, so the weight of the buckle will cause it to fall off. Unless you have the perfect hourglass body, you won't be able to use it. It's made out of a stretchy plastic material that crinkles up if you pull it too tight.<br /><br />The skirt:<br />By far the best thing about the costume. It's made out of better material, and it has an elastic waistband. Because the costume doesn't come with a petticoat, you might want to look into buying one. On me, it has about eight inches in the front before things get a little too personal, but it is pretty breezy. Meaning on a windy Halloween night, without a petticoat, you might find yourself holding the skirt down. It's a little shorter than mid-thigh, and overall, pretty good.<br /><br />The Hat:<br />Buy a new one. It's crap, like the belt. You can't really do anything to make it better; unless you have a big head, it fits loosely, the feather will most likely be broken, and the hat itself is sewn unevenly. However, I don't feel like spending the money on a new hat, so I'm going to just roll with this one.<br /><br />Sleeves:<br />These are fine. No complaints. Looks just like the picture.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />So, it depends on what you want. I think this costume will probably work for a few uses then probably hit its limit. If you were looking for a super durable, well made and overall awesome costume, look elsewhere. I like it, it fits me well (minus the belt), and other than the hat, everything is in working order. It's definitely what you paid for.ood.<br /><br />The Hat:<br />Buy a new one. It's crap, like the belt.

I am 5'4, and have fat thighs.  I also have terrible, painful varicose veins with my pregnancy.  I have tried other compression stockings, and have been unable to wear them because they are so uncomfortable (too long for my short legs, won't stay up, cut in behind my knees, etc).  So, I took a chance on these, and have been really happy with them.  They provide enough compression to make my varicose veins feel much better throughout the day, but aren't so tight that they are uncomfortable to wear.  They stay up over my growing belly, and aren't itchy.  They are fairly see-through at the top of the thigh and over the butt, but I wear them under pants every day, anyway.

I then couldn't find them in my size and the color I like so I just looked online and found them priced well. I bought a pair and when I got them they were darker than the other pair I have. I figured it was okay, no big deal to have a different color. I tried them on and they fit okay also. I thought they felt a little less baggy than the ones I bought in the store of the same size and supposedly same color. I figured they just need to be \\""broken in\\"" a little so I washed them and wore them a few times. They still felt a little less baggy and then I realized that the pockets don't feel as deep/big. I held the two pair of jeans side by side and the pair I got online actually have smaller back pockets by like half an inch in each direction. The front pockets are harder to measure but feel a bit smaller also. Again, these are supposed to be the exact same side/style/color. Maybe Levi's have changed them in the months between when I bought them in the store and the ones online or maybe these new ones are knock-offs, who knows. They are still pretty comfortable jeans and a different color so they are a little different look which is okay, I just really love the pair I got in the store and was hoping for another of the same.

She said it would help give me support by lifting and holding everything in. I ordered one and tried to give it a shot, but it was SO UNCOMFORTABLE.<br />I read a review by another user who said she was about 5'3\\"" and 115 lbs pre-pregnancy, she might have even said she had a short torso. That exactly describes me, so I totally should have believed the review. Her review said it was also very uncomfortable. But I ignored her review and ordered one anyway.<br />It was SO uncomfortable. The band that went around the underside of my belly is VERY thick (maybe a 2\\"" piece of elastic) and it was REALLY tight. It hurt against my skin on the surface -- that skin is already stretched thin, so digging in to it was not helping. And it squeezed too tight! I was wearing it one day and had to pull over while driving and take it off, I couldn't wear it sitting down. Awful.<br />I agree with all the other reviewers also who said the shoulder straps show under almost any clothing. Even in more modest crew neck shirts, it still shows! When I wore a spaghetti strap tank top over the Belly Bra and under the shirt I was wearing, it would still show. That was really annoying, especially when you feel like you look ridiculous for being 20 lbs bigger than normal -- no need to add to the weirdness.<br />I'm sure it works for some people who are the right size. But please, if you read my review and the other girl who is also the exact same size, don't buy one!",2012-06-03

I'm also not heavy (thin, I guess), and many reviews here were for feet/legs of heavier individuals. Well, they must have amazing elasticity, because the fit is very comfortable. Perhaps a tiny bit loose, but no negative impression from it. The packages lists the sizes as 10-13.<br />- Color: One reviewer said that the &#34;Black&#34; was more of a dark gray. This almost dissuaded me from buying the socks. However, I'm guessing they either received the wrong order or perhaps ordered Charcoal by accident. I ordered the black (a bit more expensive, unfortunately), and the color is a nice deep black.<br />- Length: They go up a little higher than I generally prefer (bottom part of calf; I prefer just below the calf), but still perfectly comfortable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- No long-term data yet, but quality feels quite high.<br />- Smell: yep, almost no odor after a night of miles of walking and drinking (though no dancing -- haven't done that test yet).<br />- Sweat: Feet felt good.

I am very happy with this purchase for a number of reasons.  Please allow me to explain:<br /><br />Unlike Cotton Knit Maxi dresses, this 96% Viscose, 4% Spandex blend should hold up better over time and not pill the way cotton knits due.  And yet, the dress has the same feel and flow of a better Cotton Jersey Knit. I own a number of Viscose/spandex blend dresses and blouses and while they retain all the softeness of a cotten belnd, they generally last longer and retian their shape better with less work.  I don't have to \\""block\\"" them the way one must blow a knit and I don't have to shave off the little fabric nubs (pills) that form within one washing on an inexpensive cotton knit dress.  If the bustline concerns you, rest assured that it is nowhere near as low cut as the manequin makes it appear but if you want it to be, you can adjust the crossover front a little under the stretchy hook on belt to keep a more revealing neckline in place.  You can do the same with flash tape.  However, I liked that the natural shape of the dress gives better coverage.  There is a slight learning curve to this dress since you adjust the sleeve style using the drawstring that tie at the neck in the back.  If you want a sleeveless style, you pull the drawstring taught.  If you want a slight cap sleeve, you loosen the string and gnetly tug the fabric on the arms down a bit.  You can even get the sleeve a littler lower to make a full short sleeve as  depicted. Just play with it a bit to get the desired look.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is that the the belt sits right blow the bust which is nice if you have a bit of a tummy and don't want to wear Spanx [[ASIN:B000CODK4M SPANX Higher Power High-Waisted Power Panties Shapewear]] or a shapewear slip.  However, if you are Apple-Shaped rather than hour-glass shaped, you might want to go one size up to get a little more fabric flow over the stomach. since once you put the belt on, this is essentially an empire-waist dress.  However, the design of the dress and the placement of the belt do a great job of minimizing the normal problems an empoire-waisted gown would create for a cruvier woman.  It really does look nice and has a slimming effect.  The graduated vertical color blocking createds a wonderful line with the outer black producing something of an optical illusion.  It won't make you weigh any less but it will make you look great with what you have.  I was happy with the size and length I chose but in the future, I might go up a size just for the length because I'm nearly 6 feet tall and have a long torso.  I could use a little more room in that area so the \\""waist\\"" line falls a little bit lower.<br /><br /> The belt is somewhat wide and has only one set of hardware loops to hook into but this isn't a difficult thing to handle.  I found I all I needed to do was bend back the hooks a little with needle nose pliers to make the belt more comfortable & that was no trouble at all.  Truthfully, the belt was a pleasant surprise!  I've worn it with four other outfits since I got the dress and the belt alone is almost worth the price of the dress or aat a minimum, half the cost.  it works great with a white blouse over leggings or a mini dress over capris.  I'm as jazzed about the belt as I am about the dress! Sold by itself in Macy's or a Lane Bryant store, the belt alone would set you back $50.  I know becuase I recntly bought some in very similar styles in both places. Unfortunately, the size of the belt cannot be altered unless you are handy with a sewing machine.  Still, it's an accessory and any wide stretch belt you have with an attractive loop or buckle can be substituted if you lose or gain weight.  11/3/12: UPDATE, after a brief time, the belt broke because a grommet fell off.  I contacted the company through Amazon feedback button and in 2 days I had a replacement belt that was clearly well-made and had NONE of the issues discussed above, but even ifthe belt hadn't broke, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress.  I look amazing in it and everyone compliments me when I wear it.  It can be worn in a modest way with 2 Ahh Bras( [[ASIN:B005F50KHI Ahh Bra Set of 3]]) 1 black and 1 white,  creating a color blocked look (over a beige support bar) and that is sporty.  It can also be worn with a Demi bra for Va-Va Voom Adele Sexy lady look.  You can't screw up this dress.<br /><br />If you are petite and hesitating on the length, I would say not to worry about that so much since the price is right.  Take it to your dry cleaner  or local Men's Wearhouse to have a few inches lopped off the hem.  (MW charges for the service but they're fast, fairly priced and skilled) This dress isn't likely to stay in stock long since FunFash bestsellers tend to disappear from Amazon quickly.  Honestly, finding a dress that can be worn both casually with  simple hair and no jewelry or dressed up with heels, elegant hair and evening makeup isn't an easy thing at under $100.  Viscose/spandex is very soft and quickly becoming the fabric of choice for ladies in-between a set size, merely plus size gals with an ample bosom in the 14 to 18 size area and larger sized ladies with killer curves in 22 and above.  In other words, if you're a normally shaped gal with curves, Viscose/Rayon is a forgiving blend that flows nicle and hugs you body EXACTLY where it is supposed to while it falls away in the places where it is tailored to flow nicely. It's a dream fabric!  Holy Clothing, an outfit that does a lot of Renaissance/Victorian/Edwardian & Steampunk styles uses Viscose/Spandex as well as Viscose/Rayon blends for their insanely popular peach-skin feel dresses and skirts.  I love those too.<br /><br />Overall, this is a winning dress in every respect.  It has some clever engineering and design that may take a little playing with to get just the right look for YOU but to have so many options & a great belt for  $60 is a pleasant surprise!  And, if you have any problem whatsoever, just contact Funfash - they are totally wanting to know these things.the belt hadn't broke, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress.

It's so cozy it's like pajamas, but nice enough to wear out without looking like pajamas! I ordered a large because I normally wear a large in women's tops but other reviews said this fits true to size. It actually is a little big. The sleeves are so long they go to my knuckles which is fine because I normally have trouble with sleeves being a little short. I am 5'8&#34; & I have long arms.

But, I followed others'  advice and ordered the L/XL, and I am happy to say this dress is going to be perfect for the outdoor festival season.  I ordered the purple, and it's a really great color.  I am thinking I may need another in a different color since it fits so well.  I do agree with an earlier review that the dress is not v-neck.  There are ties that look like there is a way to cinch the neckline to make it more v-neck.  However, mine also fits like a scoop neck.  One detail I didn't catch is a tie that helps cinch the waist a bit.  I like that since it is a bit slenderizing on me.  Can't wait for my guy to see me in it!",2015-04-08

The wallet comes in sturdy solid box in which you'd expect an iPad to be packaged in. The wallet screams thorough quality upon first touch... The plastic is of a tough build, and has a good amount of thickness, with the sleek aluminum shell snuggly fit to the design of the plastic. The locking mechanism snaps into place and unlocks with ease, it too is made of the same tough plastic. Inside the wallet the accordion-like slots open as the wallet does, and when closing the slots secure your important contents into place. I was a bit worried my contents would shake all around and be noisy, but that wasn't at all the case! When the wallet is fully open you are able to rest the wallet on it's spine, making it a quite easy task managing the contents of the wallet. The wallet is dust and splash proof, but certainly don't submerge the wallet for an extended period of time, though the wallet does float conveniently.. so if you were to drop it into a large amount of liquid you can quickly recover the wallet. I in fact enjoyed this wallet so much it's already replaced my current new leather wallet. I look forward to seeing how much longer this wallet will last for me as I do often go through a couple wallets a year. Also, at a fraction of the cost of what I normally pay for wallets. I do recommend this purchase as the wallet exceeded my expectations!    I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation.",2015-01-03

THIS GUY.,"After a long night of copious amounts of grain alcohol and this marvelous Appalachian potion the guy behind the local Costco calls \\""moonshine\\"", I decided I needed to buy a shirt that expresses how mystic I am as well as how a 3.2 blood-alcohol level can make you see the ghost of Christmas past spin a dreidel, of all things, precisely on a Vietnamese prostitute's areola. Only two things instantly came to mind:    John Tesh and wolves.    I ignored John Tesh, of course, and immediately jumped to wolves. Somehow I ended up here in this very listing to view what could only be described as the defining moment of my life. This shirt embodies everything I stand for. It's got three wolves, it's got howling, and it's got the moon. THE MOON. If you didn't know, we landed on that thing, so yeah. I knew instantly I had to have it and considering Amazon's great price at 73% off it meant I could possibly revisit my initial John Tesh thought.    Anyway, fast forward a few days (DAYS, people, Amazon is AMAZING) and the UPS guy delivers the shirt to my doorstep. He asked, \\""yo, kemo sabe, what's in the righteous tiddly-iteous box, mi amigo?\\"" I know what you're thinking, and yes Pauly Shore has indeed really gone downhill. \\""Listen here, weasel, what business is it of yours what I've got in this box containing only the most mystical shirt not worn on Indian reservations?\\"" I said. Mr. Shore was speechless. Then we drank more moonshine.    Later that night Pauly Shore and I went to watch Wolverine, and I wore my magical shirt... because 21 ounces of white lightning will make you think that makes perfect sense.",2009-05-19

Very good quality considering that I paid only $56 after amazon's 20% off swimwear coupon<br />3. Simple, basic, Chic..I don't like prints, low cut, or too sporty.  I wanted something understated and classic and this was very hard to find. I had been everywhere from Neimans to Everything But Water to  TJ Maxx.  The selection is very lackluster for April.  This is weird because I live in Florida.  I originally wanted the Michael Kors white swimsuit with gold belt but it sold out and there is a version of it and it cost over $500 @ nordstrom.<br />Cons:<br />1. Fits a lot smaller! I ordered a size 12 and I usually wear a size 8 in American Eagle.  I always order clothing on the larger end because manufacturers are saving money by cutting on material.  I don't know maybe it is because I wear size D bras.<br /><br />Michael Kors Inspired Look by adding gold trim<br />I tried to improvise the MK look so I added this belt trim I purchased from Joann's fabric...

It's true what other women have wrote on here about it not fitting at first.  BUT - you must loosen the ribbon on the back for you to get it to clasp in the front.  Once clasped, you can pull the ribbons to adjust the tightness.  You will need someone to help you get it on, unless you are flexible and can reach around the back to tighten the ribbons.  The design is sturdy and it has some weight to it.  It definitely forces you to sit up straight, which is a good thing because I suffer from poor posture.  Overall, great product.

They fit him MUCH better than either of us expected!! When you wash these, no worries...they come preshrunk (without the use of chemicals!!) so they will NOT shrink during the wash and dry cycles. This will also ensure the Tank Tops lasts MUCH LONGER than other brands as well. Each Tank Top is made from 100% COMBED cotton which provides a VERY comfortable, soft feeling with a GREAT fit. These will stretch nicely to conform to your body giving you a flexible fit rather than the look of actually being stretched out as other tank tops do. Since these ones were also made extra wide with very durable neck and arm lines, it makes them fit as if they were actually sewn from your own personal measurements. Another benefit is these Tank Tops are made to allow 'breathing room' so help prevent excessive sweating. I had my husband wear one to work yesterday under his T-shirt and he said it DID help with his sweating  nor did it become tight, restrictive, or anything!! These Tank Tops REALLY ARE every thing they say to be...We would definitely get more of them!!

To boot, I requested to return the product because it is defective/did not work properly. I received a message from Mystiqueshapes (product seller) stating that I could send it back as long as it was in its original packaging and unused. They also stated that the actual shipping/handling costs were non-refundable AND I would have to pay shipping to even return it!!! Unbelievable. This product is cheaply made and the seller is not accommodating at all. This makes me very sad, we were so excited about this product :( It would costs me more to try to return the product (which they may not even take back) than it would just to keep the now plain brown onesies.

I'm thinking this is probably the quality of an $8 jacket so just a tad bit overpriced like something you might find at Walmart or Target. The jacket washed well and came out softer after washing. It's not as thick as some higher end fleece like Columbia or L.L.Bean or Land's End (which are normally gonna cost about three times as much) but has a little thicker pile and is vintage looking in a cute way. Overall, I'm pleased and think this will serve well for Texas fall months and early mild winter. One thing that would improve the quality and value would be to add a lining.

Which I did get, I got a jacket with what seems like ironed/printed on pictures. BUT it was alright, it still looked really nice and clean. My issue with it though is that I got an xL... It seemed more like a large than an xL. I'm female who is 5'9, built, with broad shoulders, and has a large bust, I wear large shirts, so I have to have xL jackets.... That being the case, this was a bit tight on me on the shoulders and it had a hard time going over my chest. I have to fix the front of it every so often to make sure it stays down and does not go outwards and I can't move my arms as much because of it being a bit tight... That being said, it's still very nice. If you are built as I am, go one size up if possible, that way you have a bit more room ^^",2014-09-13

Not quite a perfect fit for us yet.,"I decided to buy the size 2T for my 15 month old daughter as a result of other reviews I read.  I'm really happy I did.  I use these jackets in the winter for layering over a warm sweatshirt in the carseat so that I don't need to try to stuff a bulky winter coat in the carseat.  This jacket doesn't have much room to zip up over the sweatshirt so I'm glad I didn't go any smaller.  I think it will be fine for spring and fall.  Right now I have the sleeves rolled up slightly on my daughter.  The only downfall of the 2T is that the hood is way too big.  When I first bought it and tried using it, it would come down over her eyes and she would scream so we have completely stopped using it.  Hopefully she will grow into it or I can figure out a way to modify it until then so we can use the hood.  I buy one of these london fog jackets at costco every year for my son.  It has a nice warm fleece layer and is perfect for spring and fall or for layering with a sweatshirt in the winter to avoid stuffing a bulky coat in the carseat.  I was thrilled to find this one on amazon and not have to wait for the costco ones to come back in stock.",2015-02-14

We’ve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness. If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel.<br />Human suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume. I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer, Holocaust or Slave costume. Why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder?<br />Stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair.

The leather is very nice and seems pretty durable. The ratcheting mechanism works well and there were no issues with it getting stuck or anything. All in all it is a very stylish belt that works well for both formal and casual uses.<br /><br />After about two months of use the release pin rivet fell out which made the belt unusable. Amazingly, a quick email to the company's support got me a free replacement buckle within a day. Free shipping and they didn't even need me to send them proof-of-purchase or customer information.

So while the bride didn't want camo and rifles running amok at the wedding, she opted to sneak in a few pieces here and there. My son's vest and bow tie were one of the sneaks. You could barely make out the camo vest under his sportcoat, and some sharper eyes did notice the tie but it's unobtrusive and classy while being camo. Once the ceremony was over, my son ditched the coat (it was hot) and the groom (while barred from wearing his camo vest at the ceremony) broke his out for the reception - they made a very stylish pair. The vest is very well made and it comes with not only a bow tie, but a necktie as well. There's a satin backing, the camo is a nice heavier material, and the bow tie and necktie are made of the same exact material. We bought the smallest size we could, my son's a lightweight, and it was still a bit big, but there is a strap in back to tighten. The satin is slippery so it wouldn't stay as tight as we needed it, but my husband very easily and discreetly was able to use a safety pin to secure it. The bow tie is pre-tied and easy to put on. To save on costs since the groom and groomsmen were in designer tuxedos, the bride authorized my son to rent a plain black suit and we used this set to dress it up. For $15 this was a great buy.",2011-10-15

These two fit poorly, like a stretchy but tight bandeau with a strange padding that moves about and shows through.  The price, in this case, should have been an enormous hint.

So far these are the only reasonably priced NATO straps w/Gold buckles I have found online so far. It's great that these are available because pairing stainless steel hardware with a gold tone watch does not look good (in my opinion). The gold buckles are a rich gold tone and will pair easily with any (yellow) gold tone watch. It remains to be seen how durable the gold finish is, but looks like it will last. The seams of the strap are stitched and this adds to the overall build quality. This is my second purchase from Clockwork Synergy and I recommend them and their products. My main gripe (hence my four star rating)concerns the length of the strap; from the buckle to end, this strap measures in at just about 280mm. While it is certainly longer than the straps I received from my last purchase they could be longer still - at least 290mm. I have also noticed a slight tendency to minor fraying at the end; this however is easily remedied by heat sealing the end with a lighter (refer to YouTube for instructions). With better sealing on the end and a few more mm's in length and these would be five star straps. Still, if you are looking for reasonably priced NATO straps with Gold buckles, this is a good buy.",2012-09-13

I was a size 4 pre-pregnancy and this has fit me fine thus far (I am 34 weeks now).  I used this initially to hold up un-zippered non-maternity pants.  Now I use them to provide additional length to a shirt if needed, to add an extra layer (New England winters are cold!), or to just smooth out my look in general.<br /><br />The lace adds nothing to you look and makes the fit of the band less attractive in general.  The lace does not have the same amount of give as the band itself, so styling the band can be more difficult.  I also found the lace would roll up.  I have a Bellaband without lace that I like MUCH better.  I would definitely not repurchase this one.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.",2013-12-31

Two weeks post twin pregnancy I have lost 40 lbs of the 60 total I gained during the pregnancy. I am currently about 210 lbs and am 5ft 4in tall.  My pants size is currently about at 20W.  The 2XL fits well around the bust and my body. It is not loose and not tight.  the fabric is a stretchy, thick and comfortable mostly cotton material with a small amount of spandex. It feels to be of good quality. It is machine washable but must dry flat it says.  I am wearing the black tank under a relatively thin beige blouse and it is not visible.  It attached easily to the front flaps of my nursing bra, the flap that unclips and folds down.  I used the small rubberbands that comes attached to the tank. The plastic clips that also come attached don't fit quite right so I didn't use those they just stay attached and are unobtrusive when you are wearing the tank.  It is quite long for me and since it is fitted to my body I just tucked it into my pants and it is not visible under my blouse.  I am very satisfied.",2013-01-07

It provides for an experience unusual for Converse: you have to \\""break in\\"" these shoes for awhile. Until then, you'd almost swear they were made of plastic instead. The leather does mean that these will last longer and take more of a beating than traditional Converse. On the other hand, that also means one must take special care of them (even if the price alone didn't tell you that); throwing them in the washing machine like regular Chucks is quite out of the question.

I try to turn them off when I check on my kids before bed, but when I can't the lights still last for a couple nights each.

It fits nicely in the shoulders and sleeve length is great. In a perfect world it would be a little more fitted in the waist as its is a tad roomy in the waist for me, but not enough to really bother me. Also this would allow me to fit as many layers as I could ever want under it with no problem at all. But that said, I was out skeet shooting the other day in 11° weather, with just a thick sweater and long sleeve shirt under it and was nice and toasty. The large, if not over-sized front pockets are great for grabbing shells with gloves on.<br />I would've given it 5-stars, if cut was a shade more athletic. Overall this is an very good cold weather clay sports jacket and I'm happy with purchase.",2015-01-09
