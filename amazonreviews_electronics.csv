We travel/fly multiple times a year for leisure, and noise cancelling headphones are indispensable. They will not block out all noise, they block out ambient background noise (the roar of an airplane), but not sudden sounds like a baby crying. But because these block out background noise, you can listen to your music or videos better, and with the volume turned down lower, a saving your hearing. For those who don't know, the noise cancelling feature is independent from the headphones. So, you don't need to be listening to anything in order to use it. And it does need a AA battery to operate the noise cancelling feature. The difference I see in these, compared to my older model, is these have a Mic on the headphone jack to use with your phone or when skyping. They also fold up.smaller.",2015-06-22

Here's a quick rundown: these are good for some music, but ruin other songs that I normally like:<br /><br />* Decemberists, &#34;Dear Avery&#34;: nicely captures the guitar and the subtle qualities of Colin Meloy's voice, but throw in the background vocals and the higher notes of the pedal steel guitar, and the music starts to get a little too tinny for my tastes.<br /><br />* Milk Carton Kids, &#34;Michigan&#34;, &#34;New York&#34;, &#34;The Ash & Clay&#34;: Here, the Aurvana earphones beautifully capture the acoustic guitar and harmonies of Kenneth Pattengale and Joey Ryan.  These are the right earphones for their music.<br /><br />* Norah Jones, &#34;Don't Know Why&#34;: This time, just 3 or 4 notes in, and the song is ruined for me.  Everything is just too harsh...I find myself wincing at certain piano notes, and parts of the vocals.  Any lows are lost to the tinny highs.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, depending on the music you listen to.  There are some nice features to note:<br />* Very comfortable and lightweight.  They feel &#34;barely there&#34; over long periods of listening.<br />* Sliding volume control: I wish more earphones had this.  I get kind of tired of the standard push-button volume controls, never knowing when I've reached the maximum volume.  Here, it's easy to slide to just the volume I want.<br />* Exactly one button: The single button works well for pausing and resuming, and for accessing my phone's functionality (Galaxy S6).  Pressing and holding is like saying &#34;OK Google&#34; to my phone.  Press and hold and say &#34;What's the weather?&#34; and I'll get an answer.  Press and hold and give a phone number, and it will call that number for me.<br /><br />One other note:<br />* The cord is entirely too long for my tastes...roughly 4 feet long.  This means it is likely to get caught or tangled if I'm moving around with these in my ear.  And, if I'm just lying on the couch listening to music...well, then there is no need for all that extra slack.<br /><br />Overall, I have mixed feelings about these earphones.  They are much better than many cheap pairs of headphones, and they have some nice features, but I'm disappointed in the quality of the sound with some of my favorite music.the couch listening to music...well, then there is no need for all that extra slack.<br /><br />Overall, I have mixed feelings about these earphones.

I've had it for over a year now and it still is preforming as designed. Works well for surround sound for watching TV and movies as well as listening to music using my iPhone, or iPad via the front panel USB port. It has good base from the sub woofer and decent sound from the other speakers. It doesn't in my opinion work well running all the HDMI capable devices through the unit. Sure it works, but it means you have to have the receiver on every time the DVR, laptop (or any other device running through the HDMI ports) is going to be used. I would much rather run everything through my TV HDMI ports and run the digital optical audio through the receiver to give me the option of having the receiver on or off. Personal preference though and not a design flaw. The remote however, is in my opinion a bad cumbersome design that could use improvement. It is awkward to hold in my hand for starters.

I listen to audio books while driving ~30 miles to and from work. I used to buy books on cd until I discovered Audible. The only problem I found was volume. Both the limited amount available as well as the ease (or lack of) of adjustment. This powerful little speaker has fixed both of those issues for me. I connect to my phone on my dashboard before heading down the road and voila I'm listening to audio book at a sound level that can compete with road noise! Adjusting the volume is easily accomplished without taking your eyes off the road. Simply feel for the old school roller adjuster thing. It stays put remarkably well on dash. That's not to say it doesn't move. I do have to nudge it back in place, but not as often as you'd expect for a spherical object! I do not use this in the open position, simply because audio books don't need base, so I can't comment on how it operates as a music speaker.

It is supposed to resume from standby when it detects audio, so long as you have not turned the device off  with the remote or with the power button and have allowed it to time out after ten minutes, but it never awoke on signal. I called NFM who suggested contacting the manufacturer. I sent one email and made three phone calls and finally spoke to a &#34;supervisor&#34; at a call center in India. He advised me that the resume feature was only meant to work for 10 minutes after the 10 minute standby function activated. REALLY?<br />Someone at JBL is stupid;  either the product developers who designed that feature, or the supervisor-level support people. No one in their right mind would design a standby features to time out after 10 minutes because people don't usually turn a television off and then back on within 20 minutes, so I am going with the 2nd level customer support people were stupid and the product was defective. Either way, an unanswered email (except for the automated response that someone will respond as soon as possible) and three calls totaling nearly three hours left  me with a very bad opinion of JBL products.

I won't bother describing the other noise cancelling headsets other than saying that they were Sony's, Panasonic's and Sennheiser's. I did not have a problem with the sound quality of in flight movies or my iPod music with them, but as far as noise cancelling functionality they are not up to the level of the Bose QC's ability to attenuate the low frequency aircraft drone.<br /><br />I do have a laugh at times when I read reviews about noise cancelling headsets and their sound quality. You are in a noisy jet engined aluminium tube, this is not the ideal environment to be comparing audio. These are not designed as audiophile headphones, their job is to reduce that monotonous drone and allow you to arrive at your destination less frazzled.<br />If you work in an office that has loud HVAC these will also attenuate most, if not all of that noise, it really depends on the environment.<br /><br />In my opinion both the QC15's and QC 25's are about the same for noise cancelling, you could be picky but there's not much in it. There are some feature differences with the 25's, you can still hear audio when the battery goes flat and they pack into a smaller case. I also carry a couple of spare AAA batteries with them, there is no point in having active noise cancelling headset that have flat batteries.<br />I still use the QC15's and my wife uses the QC25's, the reason for this is that I carry less things on a flight than she does, so with her limited purse space they are a better fit.<br />Comfort wise I have no issue with either and find them comfortable to have on for three to four hours at a time, by then I'm ready to get up and stretch my legs anyway so I take them off.<br /><br />I do need to note I do not use these around the house or office I have better headphones (Senneheisers) for listening at home which do not require batteries.<br /><br />Build quality looks and feels good to me, I have not broken any headphones (yet), if you are gentle with them, don't sit on them or drop them excessively in my opinion they will last.",2015-06-17

This was because I listened to music at work but didn't like that my headphones cable was dropped overtop or beside my keyboard and mouse area. It constantly got in the way. I though I solved the problem with my current cable but quickly realized the 2 rings didn't match up with my headphones that required 3—this is due to the microphone on the headphones. And because of the difference in rings, the sound would never come out right. It was very quiet and very muffled, so I had to fiddle with it constantly, in order to get any clarity. These new cables are EXCELLENT. They have the third ring, so that the microphone, and both sides of the headphones have their own contact points. The connection is also very nice.

Every few months it never fails that he comes home from school complaining that his headphones no longer work. Most of the time is the issue was from the speaker wires inside the ear piece detaching most likely from bumping around in his backpack.<br /><br />Since he has started school we have not had to deal with him coming home with broken headphones nor have we had to deal with his complaints of them being hard to hear out of as that was another issue with other lower cost headphones.<br /><br />These headphones have a solid sound to them.

Good sound from the dual 3W speakers all around and handles bass as well.  The built in 1400mah battery will give you some solid playing time. In our tests with our Samsung Galaxy Note 4, the speaker was super easy to pair and get to streaming music.  Call quality on this unit was also solid during our test calls. Nice matte black rubberized finish on this speaker feels nice and looks great.  NFC is included as well.  We like this speaker and handles everything that it says it does.  We do have one con, that while clever, the recharging and AUX port are on the bottom of the speaker.  This means that as you charge it or hook up a device that does not have bluetooth you will have to put the speaker on its side.  This doesn't really detract from the sound quality so we see no reason to deduct a star.

I have tried many Bluetooth and direct connect speakers for the Iphone and Ipod.  The ones that have decent sound tend to be larger due to the bass ports.  I currently use the Altec Lansing IMT320 speaker and an Apple 30 pin to lightning connector to use with my Iphone.  In looking for a smaller speaker, I came upon the Sharkk Boombox on sale and the dimensions of 7.4” by 2.3” by 2.7” looked like a good candidate.  The reviews on Amazon were very favorable so I bought one.<br /> My first impression upon seeing the box was that it was huge, but the unit is smaller than the box.  However the unit is very hefty for the size.  It weighs 1.8 pounds with is very surprising.  But when I weighed by existing speaker, with batteries and the charger it weighted about 2 pounds so the weight is acceptable.  The unit comes with a USB charger, a flat USB charging cable and a mini plug to mini plug cable along with a nice bag with tie strings to hold everything.<br /> Pairing to you device is very easy.  You turn on the unit and press the power button on the side and then press the play/pause button for about three seconds.  The unit will announce that it is in paring mode and will announce when it is paired.  The combination of voice announcements for the functions and the tones are nice since the tones and voice are not obnoxious.  The unit also connects very quickly to my phone when I turn on the speakers.  It takes about two seconds and it is connected.  While it is nice having a separate button on the top for each function: mode, next and previous tracks, play/pause, volume up and down and phone answer, it can be hard if you want to pause the unit.  You have to look at the buttons to see the correct button to press.  It is also very nice having the buttons light up when it is dark.  This makes it very easy to see what you are doing.<br />As with all speakers, the important part is how they sound.  In listening to music, I have found that the mid range and highs are very crisp with this unit.  There is bass but not a massive amount.  If you hold the unit you can feel the bass.<br />I have been very surprised by the quality of the unit and the sound reproduction.  It has exceeded my expectations when I ordered this speaker.  It is very hard to believe the sound coming from a small system.  While it does have weight, I feel that any reduction in the weight would either decrease the battery life or the quality of the sound.<br /> I have used this unit for about three days and I am very impressed with the sound, battery life and quality.  While I have not used it on a trip yet, I have started using it around the house to listen to music.  I use to stream music from the TV to my amp.  The Sharkk has replaced that and the battery has lasted all day.  As a side benefit, I can take the speaker with me around the house and still have music without having to turn up the amp by the TV.",2015-06-03

The soundstage is huge, amazingly good for games like Battlefield in particular. You really can hear when someone is trying to sneak up behind you or other small audio cues you may have missed otherwise. I only have a few minor complaints about the build itself- the microphone cannot be removed or fully swiveled out of your peripheral vision which is a little annoying if you just want to play a single player game or listen to music, etc. Also the short cable knots up alot & the integrated 'hold to mute' button is pretty useless.  If you are using the ADG1 with an Xbox One or PS4 (like I do), they seem to output at higher volume than other models I have tried so even without an amp they still sound very satisfying when just powered by the controller jack. Pair them with dedicated amplification & they get even better. Also the open back means you can hear your own voice when talking, so you don't need mic monitoring & this makes communication very easy.

They were basically the same device and they looked exactly the same and there were also some other brands that were also the same unit.  These worked great, but on an airplane you need the Koss VC20 Volume Control @ $10 each to not blast out your ear drums when there was a status update by the crew.  I felt that they did a good job of canceling out general noises on the plane and protected my hearing apon landing.  More later on that later Problem is still not fixed, as they were stored in a black pouch that I missed apon leaving the airplane and are now lost or stolen by the clean up crew.  I’m 50%, I accept.  These new units are in a black bag. Like most other models, a red LED indicates when the noise canceling option of these head phones is on (unfortunately it makes it easier for flight attendants to spot it and make you turn them off during takeoff and landing)  Silly though as it sounds you need to try to hide this LED light from them and just show the unplugged end.  I like to use these throughout the entire flight.  When I land I can hear just fine, unlike before my ears seemed tired and I had trouble hearing what others were saying…  Especially, airport officials, duty employees, and immigration personal.  I also noticed that when watching movies, the previous volume was set to ¾ max, but I’m now good at ¼ max.  and the cockpit info doesn’t blast out my eardrums like before. It went un-noticed and untold that this device included the volume control!!!  Value $10!! As for these earphones, I thought I remember the noise canceling of the box fan next to my computer is not as good as before.  And I haven’t traveled in a plane since I lost my old pair of ear buds.",2015-07-13

This cable is tested and verified to support the latest codecs (as of Jan. 2015) which is something you don't typically find advertised on your average cables, especially at this price point.<br /><br />Unlike some other A/V cables, HDMI doesn't specifically have a length limitation, it's performance is based on the cable's quality of materials and construction. This seemed to be the #1 rated option here on Amazon and many reviewers has success using it for my application, again, for the price it was a no brainier, I had to try it.<br /><br />Long story short, this cable worked flawlessly in my test run (where others have failed with dropped signal), no artifacts or visual disturbances while watching an entire Blu-ray movie.<br /><br />The cable was packaged well and the construction feels substantial. The only thing that wasn't absolutely perfect was the projector end didn't fit as snug as previous cables had but it will certainly not budget or become an issue once mounted, it just wasn't the strongest fit I've seen before.

Pairing is super simple and works well. I'm not sure how water resistant it truly is as there appears to be no protection between the speaker and the grill so the speaker itself may be water resistant.    Update: The more I've started to use it though the audio appears to cut out if it gets more than 5-6 feet away. I took away 2 stars for that since that really limits its usability.

In fact, listening to even Daft Punk (Giorgio by Morode- MUST TRY) was really awesome with these- it's like they're playing live. I wouldn't recommend these headphones if you plan on listening to heavy rap or anything with a heavy bass because it doesn't sound balanced since these headphones are designed for more acoustic style music.

I noted that it did make a difference BUT only with decent headphones, if you hook up your earbuds to this, expect to melt them or be disappointed... I have these hooked up to my Sennheiser cans to my smartphone. Usually the sound is not very powerful, but with this amp, It makes a noticeable difference. I could probably blow my eardrums if i were so inclined. But even at normal volumes, the sound is much fuller, crisp.. The EQ settings are cool.. hit the power button quickly... Blue led means treble boost, great for spoken word things, Red led means bass boost, you bassheads will enjoy this. Purple led means bass and treble, this is the setting i use most apart from just on, sounds great for Alternative, Rock and Rap.. just makes the music sound ARRRRR lol.. they claim 11 hours, all i know i have had 3, 3 hour sessions with this on one charge... that is more then adequate.. How often do you listen to headphones for over 10 hours without taking a break?  It's small and works good. I think i got a killer deal at 6 dollars at a going out of business sale at Radio Shack.. Easily worth the price, IF you have good headphones(which if you care about your music and sound, you will) Have not tried the Fio amp, but i'd imagine they are very similar.. The Cmoy Altoid tin amp was great and sounded good, unique to those that saw it, ut it is kinda big to haul around.",2015-03-15

The internal rechargeable battery supplies power for approximately ten hours and the unit is very portable and lightweight (without feeling fragile or insubstantial).  One of the most surprising traits of this loudspeaker system is its ability to provide a very credible stereo image.  Admittedly, you must sit fairly close, but the separation of sounds within the stereo spread is both believable and rock solid.

We purchased our console (identical to the photo here of antique white and brown top) from TJ Maxx for 399.99, it was an impulse purchase, but we needed a nice piece, and in 2 weeks this has proven to be exactly that.  Very attractive in person and we've had it in our living room for 12 days now. The only change we'll make is to switch out the 4 pieces of door/cabinet pulls to something better fitting our own home.  BTW-- Our cable box and a blu-ray DVD player stacked on top of the cable box fit like a glove inside the center opening, like it was made for them.

Since this Switcher is only HDMI 1.3 it doesn't allow 720p HD TV to communicate with HD cable boxes. Standard Def works fine. When switching to an HD channel, the TV can't handshake with cable box when requesting a 720p signal, so TV reports &#34;Unsupported resolution&#34; and gets no pic. I hooked the cable box up via coax and it has downstepped itself from 1080i to 720p. I then ordered a power supply for this Switcher from Amazon hoping power would help the Switcher pass a 2-way HD signal. No change. I can't recommend this Switcher, unless you have a 1080i TV. Possibly it works ok with a 1080i signal, but then some channels (Fox News, for one) don't broadcast in full 1080i.

Nice heft as well.<br /><br />Compared to seemingly endless BT speakers I have had and currently have, for the size this one is near the top.  My closest sized speaker, which is a MiPOW BooMAX, which is square shaped, but quite a bit deeper than this (which would make me think &#34;larger/better speaker&#34;), and certainly not pocketable, sounded very similar to this unit.<br /><br />I kept expecting the BooMAX to be significantly better, and while it can play slightly louder, I think I prefer the sound of this one.<br /><br />In terms of loudness, I did the same test I always do, which is to take this outside, poolside and see how it performs with 3-5 loud kids in the pool.  Using my iPhone to stream and via AUX, with speaker about 25 ft from pool, it was loud enough to not be drowned out.

The plastic cap had little rubber studs on the back of it that slid into each port and created a seal.  Seemed pretty secure.<br />♦ The speaker got really loud and had nice sound quality. Its mids and highs were clear and had decent bass for this size speaker, just don't expect big, booming, deep bass.  I attached a short video so you can hear the sound quality.<br />♦ I did hear a bit of hiss coming from the speaker, but primarily when the sound was off, so not too bad overall.<br />♦ Frequency and bass response was good for this size speaker with an audible range of about 30Hz to 15000Hz.<br />♦ Good Bluetooth range of 20+ feet and has an Aux input for wired use under the dust cap. Aux cable included.<br />♦ Has a rechargeable battery that charges with an included Micro USB cable.<br />♦ One corner had a loop that you can wrap a cord or wrist strap around, but it didn't come with one in the package.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Overall, this was a nice little outdoor speaker. The sound was was nice and clear, but lacked a bit of low end. I tried out a variety of music from some Disney kids songs to Michael Bubl&eacute; to various Bass Heavy Dubstep tracks and it sounded good with all types of music when streaming via Bluetooth from my iPhone 6.  It had some decent bass for this size speaker, but it wasn't big bass.  The mids and highs remained nice and clean. Bluetooth connection was quick and easy and had a nice range. The outdoor rugged design felt solid and the seal over the ports was pretty good. If you are in the market for a small outdoor Bluetooth speaker, this one is worth a look.a small outdoor Bluetooth speaker, this one is worth a look.",2015-05-06

The ear buds are housed in shiny silver-tone metal casings linked with a Y-cable that seems durable. They appear to be larger than the average ear buds obviously because there are two separate transducers (drivers) with a sizable sonic chamber in between to deliver deep bass with clarity at the same time. The ear buds are light weight because of the use of aluminum alloy housing. I am really impressed by the deep bass and clear details coming out of the ear buds for all the genres I tried. You would usually expect this kind of Hi-Fi quality only from large headphones. I have owned other ear buds including some from Brainwavz. Their engineers really made this design work. You will not be disappointed with the rich sound quality. Once you’ve tried them, you will likely feel that the old-fashioned single-driver ear buds are an inadequate compromise for a picky music lover on the move. The zippered hard case is stylish to carry the ear buds with different sets silicone tips (6 sets of the standard shape with different sizes, one set bi-flange and one set tri-flange silicone tips) plus a ¼” adaptor for Hi-Fi devices needing a larger plug. There is an airplane adaptor as well, although it is becoming less and less needed on modern airplanes (some even have USB charging slots!). The package would make a good gift idea to someone who is always plugged in. The 12-month warranty is a plus. These plugs are more expensive than other models of the Brainwavz product line, but for serious listeners, the price is worth the high performance. Other brands that could deliver a similar premium performance will likely cause a bigger dent on your wallet.",2015-01-09

Below is what I like and don't like about the Wios:<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />1) These are weather-resistant - I would not leave them out in the rain but I don't think they mind some water sprinkles so they work by my pool<br />2) They accept a Bluetooth signal<br />3) They can use either batteries or an AC adapter<br />4) They have a handle and can be set up easily.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />1) The biggest letdown is the sound quality. They sound muffled, lack bass and clarity. Basically imagine your $20 kitchen radio and you get the idea. You can sort of tell by listening to the video review from one of the other reviewers.<br />2) They are specified at 10 Watts per speaker but in my testing the sound distorts once I hit about mid volume so I would realistically rate them at 5 Watts. As an outdoor speaker you need a lot more than 5 Watts given the background noise. If you set them up on a deck they should be OK though as long as they are close by.<br />3) You need to run the transmitter base to be able to stream Bluetooth<br />4) When using batteries then these will last 2 hours tops if driven at moderate volume. Imagine spending $10 on a fresh set of batteries every 2 hours. They do not recharge batteries - a serious problem.<br />5) There is no way to adjust treble or alter the sound in any way.<br /><br />To summarize, I have some reservations about recommending these speakers. The sound quality simply is not up to what I would expect from a decent set of speakers. The price tag of close to $200 is too high for the quality that you get.",2015-06-21

I purchased two of these. One for Super Bowl and the second as a spare. Shipping was slow, 9 days and both ended up defective. The first one took a long time to light up and was very dim. Upon inspection, when looking the in the bulb, the reflector was blistered badly. The second one fired, look dimmer than a new bulb but better than the first. After about ten minutes, my wife asked what was burning. As it turns out, something in the projector was getting too hot emitting a burning odor. I hope there was no damage to the projector. I finally got hold of the vendor today. They told me about the warranty and said I could have replacements or a refund. I emphasized that I felt the housings were re-bulbed with the wrong bulb. They said they buy these from China prepackaged. I asked for a refund and they told me I had to pay freight back!

26707138,R11KMNSYV5XTMB,B00EWCUK1Q,779758615,SONOS Compact Wireless Speaker for Streaming Music,Electronics,5,3,3,N,Y,"Expensive, but nothing like it for the music lover","First, lets start by saying I've been searching and trying a variety of products/solutions over the past 10 years to be able to achieve the following goals 1) have access to my music library anywhere in the house with anyone in the family-- I have over 2500 digital cds on a NAS 2) stream anything anywhere (I have rhapsody, siriusXM, Amazon music, pandora and spotify accounts) 3) listen to anything on my smartphone (or more importantly the kid's own phones)<br /><br />Sonos FINALLY was the answer.  First, no one has EVER been able to deal with the size of the library with such speed and dexterity as Sonos-- my kids often re-bought stuff I already owned because they couldn't find it in the library through iTunes or other solutions.  I now have 4 - Play 1s, 3 - Play 3s, 1 Connect and 1 Boost.  Each room is clearly labeled and the kids often group their two rooms together and love playing the same thing in their game room/bedrooms.  We all use the alarm feature and wake up to music and the sleep timers.  Everyone can use their own phone (iOS and Androids, iPads and computers) to control any speaker in the house.  Grouping and un-grouping takes mere seconds and allows supreme flexibility in creating zones playing the same music.<br /><br />Sonos really has their stuff together software wise.  I often use the pc interface while in my home office and my phone just about everywhere else.  Searching for anything in the library is lightning fast and their interface to Rhapsody is actually better and faster than Rhapsody's own Windows/web interface.  And I love the ability to unleash SiriusXM to anywhere in the house (yes you have to pay the internet fee which is a few $ a month depending on your account)-- its one of my main ways to listen to what's new and fresh (Although I generally peruse and sample just about every new release that hits Rhapsody too-- which couldn't be easier on Sonos either).<br /><br />Setup could not have been easier and using the default SonosNet mesh network actually provides me better coverage than my regular WiFi (about a 5200 sf - 2 story house)-- I have never even had a single stutter or drop out.  I suppose my only complaint would be price, but when you really factor that each one of the speakers is really a Wifi repeater/internet device you realize why.  I am sure before I am done I will add at least 2-3 more Play 1s (they are very compact and make perfect ambient fill music) and another connect for the backyard (8 speaker stereo) system.<br /><br />Both the 3s and 1s sound very good and can handle putting out at very loud volume without breaking up.  Is it audiophile quality, no, but by the nature of digital music it won't be perfect but sounds great for most everyday listening occasions.<br /><br />We are yet to have a party with Sonos, but I can imagine that having every room in-sync playing the same music will just be rockin'.<br /><br />If you really love music and want to listen all over your house, I don't know of a simpler or more effective solution than Sonos.network actually provides me better coverage than my regular WiFi (about a 5200 sf - 2 story house)-- I have never even had a single stutter or drop out.

I can understand that the arms may not line up exactly with one another - meaning once attached to the wall, one bracket can be a little higher or lower than the other, which is true - but there is an adjustment knob that can account for this.

The simple style of the speaker may put off some, but its simplicity is its strength and something which I personally like. A lot has already been written about this little dynamo.   The bass on this is exceptional for its size. In fact it needs to be reigned in a bit as it tends to be boomy. The bass is good for most music except EDM which requires sub-bass levels to be enjoyed. The Soundlink III goes to about 55-60 Hz at lower volumes, but the DSP kicks in to reduce the bass notes at higher volumes. Its more like 80-100Hz towards max volume. The speaker sounds best when you use an equalizer. Its not as good sounding out of the box as it is with a user optimizable equalizer (I use it with Poweramp). The amazing thing though is that music is pushed out with tremendous power and you can hear all frequencies over a large area.  Rock music has a nice crunchiness to it. Jazz, acoustic and pop also sound quite good. There is less openness though and those expecting a lot of space between instruments might not be fully satisfied. I found the BeoPlay A2 to have a more open sound but it loses out on the pure power which the Soundlink III can deliver. This power helps it to be used in a decently sized room (400 to 500 Sq. ft.) or outdoors.  Overall, its a great buy.  Update: 03/15/2015....... I checked the Beoplay A2 again at the store today. While it sounds more open compared to the S III, the bass is lacking punch. Its clean bass, but distorts at higher volume. The S III has this ability to project bass out better. I have now used the S III for over 100 hrs and can tell that its sounding better now. The way its able to project sound is a marvel. Bass frequencies travel to all corners of the room. Its not earth shaking like a subwoofer, but theres enough presence to make the music soundfullrange and make the bass guitar and drums to be heard all over.  The high frequencies have opened up more now and there is more clarity, though not still up to the clarity of the A2. But, voices are projected well which was always a strong point with the S III.  Battery life is good and as claimed.  I am quite satisfied with the S III. The only suggestion to Bose would be to position two of the drivers facing the left and right corners in version IV. This will help separate the high frequencies even better and maybe create a more open sound. The drivers are around 4.5cm, so should fit into the 4.8cm side frame width.",2015-02-18

The audio quality is a little poor but to be expected from an underwater mp3 system. it is very easy to use and the battery does have a long lifespan. I have found that it is easy to clip on to several styles of swim suit or googles and for the most part is a very reliable product. It has been in good working order for 4/5 months now. The only downside to this product are the headphones. They are not very good. they get caught in the water and yank out of my ears. I had to get better headphones but for the most part you are getting what you pay for. highly recommended for anyone who wants a little music while they swim but will probably have to go through the extra effort of getting headphones that are of better quality.,2015-05-12

They can be worn for hours without heat fatigue.<br /><br />Next we are experimenting with every type of listening headphone experience - music videos that reveal until now unheard discrete sounds.

Concert goers exclaiming during live performances, the apparent age of audiobook narrators, the sound of each boot striking the ground in a military cadence.<br /><br />As yet I'm not thinking low/mid/high ranges like hardcore audiophiles can, because the newness of the experience makes the set almost an extension of my body.

Only thing is they really do not totally cancel outside noise; they muffle it.  I have to turn the music up to be able to get complete noise cancelling.  However, these are better than others. The ease of not having to touch the Ipod to change songs or pause overrides the noise cancelling need.

Ive used it everyday for a few weeks now and theres great quality sound with excellent bass. The microphone works well so far and so do the controls for my android when listening to music.

The button works fine, double press to skip the song, one press to start or stop a song. Didn't try with a call, but I am sure it will work.<br /><br />The downside is that the volume is really low; for comparison with a pair of sennheiser, the volume at the first segment of the phone audio setting, after vibration, was loud and clear (too loud maybe); while here with the slider all the way to max, you can barely hear anything. I had to crank the volume on the device to half, to be able to hear music at good volume in a moderately noisy environment.<br /><br />Audio quality is not excellent, but it will suffice for the occasional use. If you are looking for something better, sadly there is not much choice for the 50-90 price range, that has controls that works on Android/Motorola devices.

Won't fit all ears!,"I was one of the lucky ones who are able to say &#34;I love these headphones.&#34; These are great headphones, but let me add what I think most people miss in their review.<br /><br />the design of the ear buds will not fit everyones ears perfectly and that is directly related to sound quality and overall user experience.<br /><br />when I first got the headphones and turned up the volume I was disappointed with the bass. They sounded lacking which was a surprise because beats speakers are usually tuned for hip-hop and other bass-y music. It took me a few days to figure out that in order to get the intended sound quality that beats promises, that I needed to make sure that the ear buds had a good seal in my ears. I noticed that with a little fidgeting and a little twist that these head phones fit my ears perfect and the sound quality is amazing WHEN WORN PROPERLY. it also increases the sound isolation not only from outside sound to your ears but it also helps in keeping the sound of your headphones IN YOUR EARS and not disturbing others on the plane, in the office, or elsewhere. I can blast these headphones in a quiet room and engulf myself in all the overtones and things you don't hear with other headphones, and you could still hear a pin drop in the room with the awesome sound isolation that these offer.<br /><br />Bluetooth range is great! as with other bluetooth devices the signal seems to get weaker as the battery life gets low... to be expected.<br /><br />super light weight and comfortable.<br /><br />good tight fit but not too tight. I never worry if they are going to fall off and I can wear them for hours without hurting my ears.<br /><br />so with that being said...<br /><br />These headphones are absolutely worth trying, but understand... if you buy them and they don't fit your ears, does not mean that it is a faulty product. maybe it is just karma getting back at you and not allowing you to enjoy these awesome headphones. the only downfall is the price. i bought these because i trust the brand quality and the design is exactly what i wanted. if you are looking only for sound quality you can get equal quality for less money. but if you want a beats quality design, comfort, and functionality, then you can expect beats quality prices.<br /><br />thanks for reading. I hope this helps you. :)i bought these because i trust the brand quality and the design is exactly what i wanted. if you are looking only for sound quality you can get equal quality for less money. but if you want a beats quality design, comfort, and functionality, then you can expect beats quality prices.<br /><br />thanks for reading.

I have Bose MIE2 and Monster Turbine earphones, and I have also used two Monster JAMZ earphones. Their quality are good as well, but not comparable to RHA MA750, not to mention the build quality of RHA, which is all metal made. All my Monster earphones were broken quickly (the part connected to the phone) just after a year (too bad, right after the warranty).<br /><br />RHA MA 750 has good bass but not too heavy. It also has great clarity in treble and mid range sound. You can hear a lot of details that you cannot hear from other earphones. In addition, the over-ear design is also very comfortable, and it prevents the ear-buds falling off from your ears during walking or exercise. Overall. This is a really great earphones.

I love the plastic red caps that cover the ends of the bow ties. (It keeps them from getting bent out of shape.)  I love how this is basically TWO antennas that can be pointed in two different directions. The assembly instructions aren't the best, but I was able to figure them out. With this antenna I received 54 channels from 56.4 miles away (in one direction).  All in PERFECT condition with no dropouts or pixelation.  I was impressed, and this reception was from the inside of my attic!  Unfortunately, this antenna could not receive my favorite two channels 2-1 and 2-2, which I sadly learned are NOT in the UHF band, but are in the VFH-High band.  This antenna (as it clearly states) is a UHF antenna. If you want to receive any VHF-High channels you will need an antenna that is designed for those frequencies.  Perform an internet search for &#34;TV signals near me&#34;, and look at the FCC site and the TVFool site. Both sites are extremely helpful, and give recommendations as to the type of antenna you need and the compass-pointing information to help you aim your antenna to receive the strongest signal.  If you don't need to pick up channels 2 through 5, then this antenna will be the best antenna you ever bought!<br />I ended up replacing this antenna with a $45 model RCA ANT751 (bought from this site), and couldn't be happier. I now receive all the channels that my location can receive. (currently 56 channels total)  If you do not own a compass, there are some great compass apps for a smartphone that work great!  I am very happy to finally cut out cable tv.",2015-01-04

GREAT sounding, comfy, sturdy headphones","These are really nice headphones.  I have never had a pair like this before, only the cheapie ones, but these feel luxurious on my ears.  Very comfy, I do not see them bothering the ears at all.  My kids went through the phase of wanting some Beats by Dr. Dre, but those just never seemed to have great quality and felt too easy to break.  You can't fold these in half (why would you want to), and the ear piece swivels, so less chance to accidentally snap them where they connect to head piece.  Plus, the swivel allows them to fit perfectly on your head as everyone's head is different.  The leather padding on the head piece is top notch, I love the accent orange stitching there.  They have a great feel, nice weight, and even more importantly, the sound is crystal clear.  I am no audiophile, but quality headphones do have a nice, richer sound than cheap ones.  My daughter tried them and said the bass was not overpowering at all, she hates that, and that the music sounded very clean and clear.<br /><br />I love that fact that the wire is removable from the ear piece,  I can see my hubby wearing them unconnected to any device so he doesn't have to hear all the other noises in the house while he studies.  They don't block out all the outside noise, but definitely make things quieter.  The inclusion of two separate wires with a phone/computer jack and a standard stereo jack is awesome.  Not having to use an adapter with just one cord is nice.<br /><br />These headphones are a real treat.  I would choose these any day over the overpriced, over-hyped fancy named ones in a variety of colors.  These are the real deal.",2015-07-29

But a few months ago I decided I wanted better sound - primarily to drown out side-noises.  So I went to the local electronics store, thinking I'd spend a couple hundred bucks and get some decent speakers.<br />Yes, I'm old.  I didn't know you can't just buy a pair of decent speakers for a couple hundred bucks anymore.  But the guy there talked me into trying this Polk Soundbar.  Since this store NEVER has grief about taking items back, and I had some time to kill, I went for it.  I didn't want to spend near that much, but man am I glad I let that guy talk me into a trial.<br />I absolutely LOVE this thing  Not only does it give amazing sound at volume levels far beyond my needs, but it gives me tons of sound I never knew I was missing!  And talk about easy to set up and use!<br />Unfortunately, the Digital line won't let the TV control the volume.  Since I have my remote programmed to let the TV do volume for all my A/V devices, computers, etc. I had to use the standard aux plug instead.  Like I said, I'm no audiophile, but I seriously cannot tell the difference between the digital and the aux jack - and the aux lets the TV control the volume, so I'm a happy camper.<br />It has some extras too, like the bluetooth.  That set up very easy, and is handy for when listen to audiobooks on my androids.  It claims to have NFC for setup, but I never got that to work, so I can't speak for that.<br />My only real beef is that if I'd known, I'd have gotten it through Amazon and saved about $150.

Perfect size in my opinion!,"Ever wanted a 4 port USB smart charger with multiple power lets? Well BAM! Innovation! The Pluggable PS2-USB4 is my new favorite portable USB charger. Details below.<br /><br /> ▶ Package Contents<br />• Plugable Dual AC Outlet with 4-Port USB Smart Charger<br />• 5’ AC Adapter Cable<br />• User Manual<br /><br /> ▶ Specifications<br />• Sleek matte black design to match professional business products<br />• Provides easy access to AC power and USB charging ports<br />• 2 standard US 3-prong grounded power outlets (no surge protection)<br />• Both outlets accommodate larger “wall wart” style power adapter bricks<br />• Built-in 4-port 34W (6.8A) USB smart charger<br />• 5 foot removable power cable<br />• Designed for 100-240V at 50/60Hz<br />• Models come with either US wall plugs (Amazon US and CA markets) or universal outlets types A through L (UK, EU, DE, FR, ES, IT)<br />• Over-current surge protection (power strip shuts off if attached AC devices pull too much power)<br /><br /> ▶ Hardware<br />The Pluggable PS2-USB4 is a very simple smart USB charger with two well spaced (1.1”) grounded power outlets. I like that this uses four “smart” USB chargers because there is no need to worry if one outlet is 1A or 2A, instead this will give your mobile device the fastest possible charge.<br /><br />My most favorite thing about this surge protector is the combination of the size of the surge protector, and the length of the power adapter (5 feet). This uses the same USB power cable as a monitor or computer tower would. Although the PS2-USB4 is a little on the bulkier side (probably due to the two power outlets), it is large enough to comfortably fit on a desk, or my couch, and extend my short USB cables to my tablets and phones without reaching for the wall adapter. Usually, I would be required to reach for my longer USB charging cables on my USB wall adapter – those cables don’t seem to charge fast enough. I’m really liking the convenience of not worrying about my USB cables.<br /><br />On the top of the surge protector is a single blue LED to indicate that the surge protector is on. This is also able to be turned off by the switch on the right side. On the bottom are two rubber feet.<br /><br /> ▶ Testing<br />First, I had to test these two power outlets. I was capable of fitting my [[ASIN:B00MOHYJAY Mpow® 25W/5A 4-Port USB Wall Charger]] and [[ASIN:B00L59D9HG 3DS/3DSXL Wall Charger]] without any issues. There was in fact some room to spare. Definitely a great feature.<br /><br />I’ve used the smart charger on my OnePlus One, an Android phone with a 3100mAh battery, running CM11S. My results were below:<br /><br />6:18AM – 7%<br />6:48AM – 38%<br />7:08AM – 60%<br />7:48AM – 93%<br />8:18AM – 100%<br />Total Time: 2 hours<br /><br />Total Charge = Battery Capacity (3100mAh) x Amount Charged<br />3100mAh x 0.93 = 2883mAh<br /><br />Charge Per Hour = Total Charge / Total Time<br />2883mAh/2h = 1441mA per Hour<br /><br />The charge rate of 1441mAh is about a 2.21 TIMES FASTER than my normal charge rate of 650mAh/h. This is SUPER SUPER FAST. I love it!<br /><br />▶ Final Thoughts<br />The PS2-USB4 doesn’t take up any power outlets, includes an extra power outlet, and then adds 4 smart USB charging ports while maintaining portability. There literally is a win win situation! That’s why this product gets my recommendation with a 5 star rating.<br /><br /> Pros:<br />+ Fast charge (2.21x Faster than normal)<br />+ Portable (for amount of features)<br />+ Smart charging USB ports won’t confuse you<br />+ Power outlets are well spaced (1.1”)<br />+ Long power cable (5’)<br />+ About the perfect size for a desktop charger<br />+ Power switch<br /><br /> Cons:<br />- Is a little bulkier than expected<br /><br /> I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.ue LED to indicate that the surge protector is on.

The instructions for tuning the radio and saving the presets are extremely limited and basically amount to &#34;press the scan button and it will scan available stations into the 20 presets&#34;. There is not a way to choose which station is assigned to which preset. It basically starts at 87.7 and saves the first 20 stations. There's not even a way to get to other stations that might be on a higher frequency than the 20th preset. It makes the radio  nearly (but not completely) unusable.",2015-05-24

But, sometimes I hear sounds on the edge that seem like they could be more audible and clearer. This amp seems to bring out these sounds. It brings out the bass too but not too much. Now you can spend a lot on audio equipment as anyone who has read Sound and Vision and Audiophile magazines would know. There are headphone amps for 10 grand, system amps for 100 grand and speaker systems for many thousands. These magazines smugly announce that they are for the one percenters and only review the very finest. But you don't have to spend this kind of dough to hear good sounds or put on airs about it.

If you're not very handy, there's a couple of tricky aspects to the installation that aren't spelled out very well in the instructions.  Assembling and mounting the rectangular wall bracket - pretty straight-forward (a stud finder makes life easier but the level that's included is a nice touch).  Assembling and securing the vertical brackets to the VESA mounting points on the TV was also pretty straight-forward.  You WILL need to reference your TV owner's manual to determine which screws to use.  You will also go through a few iterations of &#34;adjust the tilts, hang the tv, measure for levelness, take the tv down, adjust, hang, measure, repeat&#34;.  Once you get that figured out, you'll want to do all your power and input/output connecting BEFORE you hang it again.  Unless you have tiny arms and the dexterity of a jeweler, you're going to have a tough time cabling everything up with the tv hanging on the wall.  And finally, to turn the bottom securing screws, you're going to need a long Phillips screwdriver and no obstructions below the bottom of the tv.<br /><br />I'm all about a value play.  I'd put this product in the &#34;great value&#34; category.  The cost was a fraction of what you find in the big box stores, it's well built and, with it properly installed, I feel as though it would support MY weight if I were to hang on it (which I won't - why would I?)",2015-04-16

The shelves lack enough support to keep the front from dropping a bit.  For example, I placed an audio receiver on one shelf.  It weighs 18 lbs (the unit is rated for 66 lbs, so you'd assume at least 22 lbs per shelf would be ok) but still caused the front of the shelf to slope down.  I ended up using a zip tie through one of the ventilation holes and securing the shelf to a bar that was mounted above.  It might have been ok, but...

Most items in the home are hung into the drywall using appropriate anchors. 2.  The TV/monitor &#34;wobbles&#34; once attached to the unit.  I attached a 37&#34; LCD TV, but it only weight 15 lbs.  The unit is SECURELY mounted to the wall.  But, when I reposition or move the TV, it &#34;bounces&#34; or wobbles, although the mounting unit does not.

I may use them on my riding mower since they block out so much sound. I can't totally steer anyone towards either set of headphones. I would say get both since they are so affordable. I use them both. And to be honest, I had to switch back and forth 10-20 times between 3 sets of headphones to pick out the subtle differences of each pair. I use all three. The other ones are from monoprice- My least favorite. Only the most critical audiophile can pick out the differences between most of the headphones at this price. Go for beats if you have the cash.

I was a little skeptical of this speaker when it first arrived - it’s green and it has a light in it - but it has turned out to be one of the very best speakers we have used. There is only one Bluetooth speaker I have seen that is better and it cost north of $300.<br /><br />This is a very unusual speaker in that is serves double duty, as a speaker and as a lantern. As a lantern is it sufficient to serve as a camping lantern or as a light for moving around the house when the power is out. It casts a tremendous amount of light. It has a loop handle on top so it can even be carried as a lantern, which makes this speaker a little easier to carry and mount than most.<br /><br />The lantern portion of this speaker has two light settings - bright and very bright. There is a single button on the speaker that operates the light and the settings can be cycled by repeatedly pressing that button. The lantern’s light is from a very strong LED, and when the speaker is opened to look like a lantern the light passes through a woven nylon mesh that casts a soft, pleasant light in all directions, much like a camp lantern. When collapsed, there is a lens on the bottom of the lamp that causes the light to spread more since the LED is close to the lens and as a result it acts like a miniature spotlight from the bottom.<br /><br />Ok, the light works great. But, I was more interested in the sound. I set out to test the sound capabilities and this is where things got very interesting.<br /><br />I paired it to my computer and connected to it. It broadcast its ID as “OUTAD” and once the connection was complete (it took maybe 10 seconds) I started feeding music to it. I was dumfounded by the sound profile it demonstrated - absolutely brilliant highs that are exceptionally detailed, a warm and rich midrange giving the music body and a deep and rich bass that held up at lower volumes. This is phenomenal for a Bluetooth speaker, particularly at this price point.<br /><br />I connected to a more expensive Bluetooth speaker. Rather, I connected to a matched stereo pair with the intention of comparing the two. This speaker sells for a fraction of the price of the stereo pair. When I compared them back to back, the stereo pair was better which is no surprise, but the sound difference was not in line with the price differential. The sound profiles were only subtly different, mostly in the midrange.<br /><br />The range test on this speaker was next and it very much exceeded expectations. We separated the sound source from the speaker and started walking through the house...and up the stairs...and up a second flight of stairs and to a point roughly 75' away before the sound finally started to get a little intermittent. Most speakers are good to 20'-30' at most.<br /><br />The speaker provides all of the usual controls as well - forward/backward track skip, volume +/-, play and pause. The on/off switch is separated from the other buttons and controls.<br /><br />This little speaker is among the best I have used. The sound quality is off the chain and the fact that it doubles as a lantern is a bonus. That this unit is so inexpensive in comparison to its quality is just frosting on the cake.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.midrange giving the music body and a deep and rich bass that held up at lower volumes.

I’m glad I was able to purchase this Jarv NMoiton Pro Wireless ear buds at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased evaluation and review.  I truly do like them.<br /><br />These fit comfortably in my ears, right out of the packaging, but several options were included so there’s multiple fit choices.  I tried the ear stabilizer attachment but like the feel of these slightly better without them (and I don’t need them to keep the buds in my ears.)<br /><br />Kudos for using a standard micro USB connection for charging.  I’m able to charge these headphones with the same cable I use to charge my Kindle, so that makes it very convenient to be able to use what is already plugged into my charging station.<br /><br />The buds are clearly marked for right and left sides.  The controls / mic go on the left and are well-defined to the touch, making it easy to know which is top, middle, or bottom buttons.<br /><br />These pair flawlessly with my iPhone 6 in about 10 seconds.  I appreciate that the name is NMotion Pro on my screen because I have several devices that just list numbers and sometimes I get confused about which is which.<br /><br />Audio is clear (I mainly listen to talk radio) but music also sounds very good to my ears (I’m listening to James Taylor while typing this review… love James’ music!)  I honestly haven’t used these for phone conversations, so cannot comment on the mic quality as far as what the other person hears.  I didn’t get these for that purpose.<br /><br />Excellent sound, comfortable in my ears, intuitive controls, and flawless pairing with my phone – plus the bonus of standard micro USB so I don’t have to keep track of an unusual charging cable - have earned this pair of Jarv earbuds a solid 5-stars from me. I am very pleased with this purchase.",2015-06-26

The problem turned out to be that the sensor on the remote I was trying to copy was hidden behind a plastic window and was off to one side - not in the center.

It's also nice that it seems to be performing quite well so far.  I wanted it for convenience and it certainly is convenient.  Love the way it compresses into a little disk that can be safely stowed in the nice drawstring sack they sent with it.  Since the manufacturer is willing to back it for 3 years I can be confident that it isn't junk manufacture.  I've been caught by that junk stuff before and I don't like it.  So, five stars for this one!  Here's an update.  I was given a nice Amazon gift card and decided to use it (in part) to purchase a second one of these little speakers.  I was finding that the volume of a single speaker sometimes wasn't enough, especially when I am working out in my wood shop.  Stringing the two speakers together is just right!  I can listen to an audio book, some good Christian music, or whatever and hear it just fine while I'm working on a project.",2015-05-09

I bough couple of accumulator batteries, however sometimes I forget to charge them. All of these are such a pain, I think it would be great if Bose will add some sensor that can switch off the battery or at least send it tot sleep mode (I understand there are some technical issues might be).<br />2) After some time your ears start sweating, especially if you are in a room with 75+ degrees (F). It's uncomfortable. Sometime I put some materials, so sweating on my ears become a bit less problem. Is there are a way to solve this? Maybe to use other material, or put some holes with ventilation, but I know that could affect noise canceling effectiveness. Please Bose engineers solve this, that would be so cool!<br /><br />Other than that, guys I highly recommend this piece of engineering.

Just do it.,"I don't usually write reviews, but I need to for this product.<br /><br />I used to go through headphones like crazy. For a while I bought $40 V-Moda Bass Freqs, which sounded great but reliably broke after 4 or 5 months of use. I'll admit that I was rough with them: I slept wearing them, I worked out in them, I threw them around my room and into my backpack. Eventually, enough was enough and I figured I should break down and spend money on a reliable pair of headphones, to give me some incentive to be nicer to them. I got the $80 Klipsch R6's. Aaaand, they broke after 6 months.<br /><br />Demoralized, I went online to continue my search for more expensive headphones known for their durability. In the meantime, however, I bought these as a way to tide me over. And I'm so glad I did. At $18, they sound just as good as the V-modas and even the Klipsch's. (I'm not a complete audiophile but I love music. I produce for fun ((FL Studio ftw)) and play guitar and use my Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro's for anything more technical).<br /><br />The MEElectronics M6s sound extremely clear with a fantastic high end; insane when you compare them to similarly priced Skullcandy's and the like. The bass response is modest but respectful, with a bump around 100 hz to bring out the kick, and the mids sound rich without muddying up the sound. I listen to indie rock, hip hop, R&B, alt rock, rap, and edm. For all of those except the most bass-y of songs they sound great (and you're not gonna get a good thumping bass from any in-ear headphones anyway).<br /><br />Most importantly, I've replaced these headphones twice in the three years that I've owned them. And I've been more rough with them than any headphones I've owned, because I trust that I CAN be. It's a great peace of mind. The over-the-ear fit takes a little while to get used to but you'll learn to love it and will find that it's pretty comfortable. The first pair I owned shorted out after a year, I don't know why. The second pair lasted over a year and a half until the memory wire broke and poked a hole through the plastic cord (and also my ear, lol). I'm now 9 months into my third pair and ordering another because I want to have them available right away if these ever break. And did I mention they look pretty cool too? The see-through casing is fun to show off to friends.<br /><br />Long story short, if you're looking for a durable pair of headphones, try these on. In my experience they sound great and fit comfortably, and if you don't like them you're only out the cost of a movie for two (and not a five course meal, like some brands..). I got lucky finding these and I hope this review helps someone else out too.d over a year and a half until the memory wire broke and poked a hole through the plastic cord (and also my ear, lol).

I was expecting something really reliable, and they aren't.  The phones themselves are fine, with nice bass response and good overall sound. The problem is with the wireless system. They keep cutting out, and suddenly you find yourself with an awful, deafening WHITE NOISE IN YOUR EARS.  It's something to do with the automatic signal cut off, obviously, which is designed so that the batteries don't die when you put the phones down and not on the charging cradle. But there seems to be issues so that it doesn't properly pick up the audio signal, so that you find yourself watching a video and you either hear nothing, or it'll suddenly cut out.  There should at least be the option to turn this function off, but there isn't. And consequently, these headphones are pretty much useless to me.  I don't want to be deafened every few minutes, thanks.",2015-04-28

The assembly was straight forward, getting the snaps which tighten the screen to the border was a little difficult because of the tension, but it gave me assurance that the scree wouldn't bulge. The hangers suggest two screws and the screws provided are made of a week metal and too long. I would suggest going to the hardware store and purchasing your own screws and tightening them as so two aren't necessary.<br />Other than that, it looks great and the nice, soft, and attractive velvet border absorbs any over projection which may exceed the screens limits.<br />The projector apps suggest a grey screen if you are using this in a highly illuminated room.

Over all build is decent.<br />Some slight imperfections on both the metal and wood.  Cable is on the thinner side<br />and can be prone to some Microphonics.  No were as nice as the cable on the 8MM.<br />Strain relief seems sufficient, though the weak spot seems to be at the driver housing.<br />No issues to report as of now.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />The wood housings are no too large, so insertion is an easy fit.  Though I will<br />be honest, I've never been able to use any size silicon tips.  I just quickly put on a set<br />of Comply T-500 tips that fit and work great.  These can be worn for a lengthy amount<br />of time with minimal discomfort.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br />I expected these, being made out of wood to have a warm signature.  Though right away<br />I noticed that they had a whiff of coolness to them.  Crystal Clear cross all frequencies.<br />Instrument Separation is outstanding; I'm guessing this is due to the dual drivers.

My son said it is warmer but he only knows low FI solid state amp. It has some charateristics of tube amp, fuller and but a lot less controlled. Bass is roll off and shift in EQ that emphasize mid and high, good ones with some hearig lost for enhance high notes. Notes are lingering longer but silence between notes is lacking. This result in very busy listening. The unit also enhance the gain some what so I have to lower the volume 2 clicks. I used to have the Sansui D-105 tube CD player. That unit was airly, clean and controlled. When see so many good review so I was hoping it provide tube like sound that I missed. No chance. This is not a bad unit. Just not what I expected. For around $200, I am not complaining. It would be good for my old Adcom 555II amp but not the current set up.  Update: After more time to burn in and better wire management, It surely earn more stars. I have to retract my comment on very busy sounding and bias on high notes. Sound is much warmer with extra burned in time. High is less noticeable with slightly more extended base. Busied sounding was mostly due to my poor wires management. After installing the Sanus EVAV40-B1 rack with more separation of wires and between components, sounding is much cleaner. Silence between notes increase but surely cannot have the control of pure good solid state equipment. What it gains for what little it gives surely worth more than the asking price of this product.

I purchased the second set so my wife and I can both enjoy late night movies and not wake our roommates, who's headboard wall is shared with my home theater speakers.<br /><br />One feature I really enjoy is that they breath. I have a pair of Bose QC2 headphones and had a pair of Beats Studio Wireless headphones as well, both sets have great sound and great noise canceling but part of noise canceling is sealing up the cups. These Sennheiser 180s breath nicely so you can wear them for hours on end without your ears getting all sweaty. Also this means that you can talk to someone right next to you without shouting at them.  I chose to purchase a whole second set with the receiver instead of a stand-alone set of headphones (no base) because i like both headphones to be constantly recharged to their fullest. I have both sets synced to one base unit, the second only serves as a recharging station.<br /><br />Overall I love them.",2015-01-12

The unit includes a DC adapter to plug into a regular outlet to power the pre-amp.  Adapter block is small, which is always nice.    Yes, I do have to turn the volume up a few clicks higher to get the same volume from the turntable as I do the other sources (CD, TV, DVD, etc) in my system, but I can't complain given how compact this unit is, and how easy it made integrating vinyl into my listening choices.

Check the user manual; to save a playlist you can't just sync a playlist as you can with any other Sansa mp3 player, but instead have to physically move all of the files to a new folder on your computer, and go through a 5-step process to convert it to a form the Clip Sport will recognize as a playlist. My trusty old Sansa m250, which I have been using for years, works seamlessly with both Rhapsody and WMP playlists even through all of the updates to those programs.

And I think my experience with this purchase covers all the bases.  I bought this system and it arrived fairly quickly.  Looking at it, it appears cheap.  However, it's merely a transmitter/receiver... in essence a very simple radio device.  So I wouldn't have expected it to really be made out of anything other than plastic and mass produced circuit boards.  What DOES concern me is that when you plug it in, sometimes there will be sparks from the outlet and from the device.  Once plugged in, it's fine.  But it really should include a grounded plug, not the one they provide.  Any way, I connected the transmitter/receiver and it worked well for about 3 days.  Then the left side receiver failed and began popping, cracking and was generally unusable.  I unplugged it and emailed Amphony.  They replied in a day or so with an RMA number and instructions to return it.  I sent it back and they accidentally sent me a transmitter instead of a receiver.  A mistake which they promptly remedied.  So I received the new unit and connected it with no trouble at all.<br /><br />Now, the first one I received was defective.  The new pieces work very well.  They have enough power for my smaller satellite speakers (Polk Audio RM 705) which run between 20-100 watts.  If you stand in the line of sight of the transmitter to receiver, it sometimes pops a little bit or cracks, but returns to normal after a moment.  I like it, but it isn't without its flaws.<br /><br />Amphony's customer service was superb.  They were prompt and very considerate.  I had to keep after them a bit, but they were responsive and didn't give me the run around.  So it's clear that they understand the importance of customer service.  I would buy another Amphony product.",2015-06-09

Don't, if you are an audiophile.","I've experienced, used, owned a handful of headphones and I bought these off a friends recommendation in which he said, &#34;These are the most underrated headphones.&#34;<br /><br />After finally losing my Klipsch Image S4 earphones, I figured I give these a try. This is my verdict after a good 2 weeks of use.<br /><br />Noise Isolation: Average<br />The earphones are pretty good at passively blocking out any exterior sounds. They are not superior to more expensive Sennheiser earphones such as the IE 80s, however, they are better than earphones like the Bose SoundTrue which do not completely seal the ear from exterior sound.<br /><br />Comfort: Average<br />The earphones were moderately comfortable, they did not bother me or irritate me, however, they weren't amazingly comfortable either. They were just average. I still feel that my Klipsch Image S4s were more comfortable because of the oval-shaped silicone tips, in addition to slight angle in which the headphones entered the ear. These Sennheiser CX 300 II earphones are ton more comfortable than the Etymotic Research MC5 earphones, which required me to take them out of my ears every 15 or so minutes because my ear-canals were so irritated with them.<br /><br />Sound Quality: Average<br />The sound review is sometimes difficult to describe as good or bad due to individual preferences. However, I noticed the following when using them on various genres of music as well as movie viewing on my laptop. The earphones give a significantly better sound experience than your standard (free) earphones that you receive from Apple and even Samsung.<br /><br />The most notable aspect of the product is the bass response, which is slightly over-powered, yet enjoyable depending on your taste in music and preferences. It can be characterized as a &#34;fun&#34; audio signature. However, those who enjoy accurate sound reproduction with crisp mid-range and highs will be disappointed. The mids and highs feel distant and slightly washed out. The sound quality of the Bose SoundTrue, Klipsch Image S4, and even Sennheiser CX 5.00 are better all around in comparison, but they come with greater price tags.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />The headphones, for the price and quality are very appropriate. If you value solid sound quality or you consider yourself somewhat of an audiophile like myself, you will not be impressed. However, if you just want an upgrade from the basic earphones these are definitely a pair to consider. The noise isolation, comfort, and sound quality are average when considered to the whole scheme of earphones. Yet, for the price and the level of quality when compared to basic earphones... you really can't go wrong.<br /><br />In the end it is merely a decision based on preference and budget.out.

I bought them because someone I know really likes them and says they are great for him as a runner because they snap into place in your ear (you turn and snap them into your ear canal according to the manual that came with). I am not a runner but I travel a lot by plane and like to have earbuds that are small enough to carry in my pocket and yet block out noise, so I purchased these.<br />Maybe my ears are different sizes but I found on the left ear it worked great. However on my right ear they hurt bad. So bad that after wearing them for an hour to break them in, I couldn't wear different earbuds the next day. The cartilage in my upper ear was really sore. I tried wearing them a couple more times and fiddling with the positioning but they just didn't work. Usually if I buy something from Amazon and it doesn't work for me I just pass it on to someone who would want it, but I didn't want to pass on something that had been in my ear (I realize they could have cleaned them with rubbing alcohol, but I wouldn't want someone else's old earbuds) so I tossed them.<br />If they happen to fit your ear they are a great buy, but for the percentage of people who can't get them to fit (you can get an idea of that number from the 1 star ratings) it will be money wasted. So you are kinda rolling the dice.<br />Mine ended up in the garbage.",2015-07-06

I searched Amazon for something less than $20 and came across the Bingoo i810 earphones.  I was a bit sketchy about this purchase due to the reviews, but decided to chance it.<br /><br />Upon receipt I was slightly impressed with the packaging. Nicely secured in a hard plastic case, with all of the seal stuckers well intact.  The package included the earphones, 3 sets of various size ear pieces, a nylon pouch, and a round button looking thing.  The images on the package don't say much about what this round button thing is and the instructions are all in Japanese.  I searched online and still wasn't able to figure out what that is for; so I gave up since most earphones don't have it anyways.<br /><br />Initial use was a bit strange.  Earphone fits comfortably in my ears, doesn't block out much outside noise, picked up white noise (not enough to be irritated), and the left side produced extremely faint sound; while the right side worked fine.  I unplugged from the jack and reengaged the connection, and this time both sides worked.  I figure it's probably due to my error not fully engaging the connection.  Sound quality was better than I expected for the price I paid for these.  I got to enjoy these earphones for 2 weeks then suddenly both sides stopped working.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to a friend and would not buy this again for myself.",2015-08-13

Apple revolutionized the portable music player domain with the iPod and no one has really even begun to encroach on that domain.  And that is unfortunate because not everyone likes Apple products and there are so many other possibilities to support portable music/audio.<br /><br />First off the pros...<br />+The sound quality was actually very impressive.  I tested a whole range of styles, formats, and volumes and also tested using a headphone amp (several Fiio models.)  In all cases, this unit has some pretty dang good output.<br />+Support out of the box for many file formats.  Yes, I am a FLAC geek and yes I also do listen to mp3s but the ability for a player to support a wide array of formats is VERY important.  I stopped using my iPod so long ago because I didn't want to be locked into the Apple loss-less format.  And hence I migrated to FLAC.  FLAC is open, solid, and stable regardless of where you stand on lossy vs lossless argument.<br />+The unit had features that others didn't.  Example A-&#62;B repeat.  While this is a simple feature, I actually quite enjoy it.  Often I find I would like to use it for looping segments of songs that have relaxing moments (without the entirety of the song); very few if any devices have this feature.<br />+Being a smaller/newer company having the brass to step up and challenge the iPod throne.<br /><br />Now the cons...<br />------Controls!  I just could not understand the controls.  Yes I read the manual.  Yes, I tried it several times. I am an engineer...I am not stupid.  These controls were so unintuitive to me that this made me return the device.  If these were better I would have kept the device.  Why when playing a song or navigating a directory, if you hold the center &#34;M&#34; button does it return to the top menu...and when you do this you cannot navigate back to the song in the directory tree.  If you do, the current song stops playing. ---Could not get Library functions to work for the SD card.  I already had preloaded music in directories separated by artist/album directories.  These files were never picked up when doing library updates and hence I could not browse by genre or artist.  I would always have to navigate into the directories to play the music.<br />-No on the go playlist. This is a very simple but the most useful feature I find in PMPs.<br />-The pictures do not do the justice that the unit feels very cheap.  The pictures make the unit look rock solid but in fact it is not. The buttons feel like they will break.  The screen can be pushed in.  I just felt it was not going to last.  Very different quality feel vs a Sandisk Sansa device for roughly the same price.<br />-Could not remove useless thinks like Games, eBooks, etc.  Who the hell is going to read an eBook on a device like this?  I need the ability to hide those features like I can in iPods or Sansas.<br /><br />Again, I really wanted to like this.  It supposedly had everything.  It even has orange trim!  I rarely return Amazon products.  But with the top issue of Controls, I just could not feel that the device warranted the price paid.  With just that one issue fixed, I would probably buy this product again to retry it.  To Kubik, keep at it and DO try again...I feel the product is on the right track but needs some more work.",2015-01-01

I was not given any incentive to provide a 5-star or even a positive review for this item. MEElectronics makes quality products and wanted my critical, honest opinion on what they could do to improve their product as well as an informative review for their customers.<br /><br />That being said, this product deserves a firm '5 stars' for the features and quality it brings at the price. It's hard to even find any aux cord at this price, and to have one that also couples in hands-free controls, as well as with a strong build quality that doesn't break or create choppy audio inside of 90 days is impressive.<br /><br />What I loved:<br />-Build quality: The build quality of this item is impressive. Nice, flat lying cables that don't tangle or twist. Very easy to manage inside my car or at the gym. The ends feel solid and have not gotten week during the three months of heavy use.<br />-Hands-free Calling: Works as you'd think. I can toss my phone in the passenger seat and plug it into the aux in my car. I leave the end with the microphone plugged into the aux port in my center console so that the mic (to which I speak) is positioned accordingly. The caller on the other end is heard through my car's speakers. No issues! Great volume and clarity with no complaints on either end.<br /><br />What could be improved:<br />-This item was clearly meant more for hands-free use rather than for media controls. Like I previously stated, this item works very well for doing hands-free calls in your car if you're lacking bluetooth or other means of doing so, but the controls for media (music, etc.) were lacking in my honest opinion. You can skip songs by quick pressing the answer/hangup button, and can volume up and down, etc, but the controls are clearly more optimized to be friendly for calling features. This doesn't make the item lose a star in my book, since this isn't its main function, but a better media controller would be handy.<br /><br />Overall this item works as advertised and has excellent build quality. I'd be doubtful that there's any competing product on the market with as good of a value.s main function, but a better media controller would be handy.<br /><br />Overall this item works as advertised and has excellent build quality.

TIVO IS BETTER SO DON'T LET COMCAST TAKE IT FROM YOU!,"Not only does this work great, it has a lot more tools and buttons than the remote that came with my original Tivo HD.<br /><br />For those of you considering switching to Comcast's DVR options instead Tivo, DON'T.  This is a perfect example of a small private company that came up with a brilliant idea, and a massive, greedy corporation trying to steal it.  Don't let them do it!!!  More and more great products are not being invented because huge corporations find ways to either pay very little, or steal the idea completely.<br /><br />I won one of the first 200 Tivo's that were ever invented by writing an essay.  I told them I wanted a Tivo because I wanted to watch what I want, when I want, without the cable company telling me when, and then watching their endless commercials.  Over the years, Comcast has been trying everything it can think of to shut them down.  They refused to provide M-Card's until the FCC said they had to.  After that, they would lie to customers ad said there were none in stock.  When they got busted again, they forced customers to go pick them up.  And every step of the way they would go on and on about why a Tivo DVR is better.<br /><br />I'll save some time.  IT IS NOT.  It has none of the options like Wishlist, Music and other tools.  It forces you to buy movies and a bunch of other nonsense.  It's not enough that they force you to buy cable if you only want Internet.  It's not enough that they force you to buy packages when you want one channel, they force you to buy 20 you don't.  They fight to make sure you have no choice but to buy what they want when they want for how much they want.<br /><br />Tivo is one of the rare examples where they were not able to crush the competition.  Make sure people in your life know that.",2015-07-18

I searched many products and read countless reviews and finally decided this was the one for me.  As expected, prime two day shipping resulted in on time delivery.  The speaker came in very attractive packaging and had easy out of the box playability after connecting the miniUSB charger followed by very simple pairing.  Disappointingly, the sound was far less than I expected after reading the description and the reviews [but I eventually discovered that mine was defective].  The little blue LED that let you know that it had power and was charging flickered red with the volume up which gave me my first wave of skepticism.  I later realized it only paired and played while connected to the charging cable.  The battery didn't seem to charge at all.  After leaving it plugged up all night and then disconnecting the mini usb from the charge port it was completely powerless the next morning.  Maybe mine was defective [it was] but I'm only willing to put my money on something and be fooled once.  Unfortunately for me, I haven't found a speaker that attracted my interest as much as this one.  If you decide to go with this product on the hope that my experience was the exception, I hope you have far better results than my own...but don't say you weren't warned.  I'm just glad Amazon has such an exceptional return policy.  [After returning this product and buying a different one from a local store, the seller contacted me and offered to send me another one at no additional charge.  I have used it for two days now and both days have exceeded my expectations.  The sound is better than what I expected from a small wireless Bluetooth device and the battery lasted all day long while I was at work.  I only turned it all the way up for a short time because I didn't want to disturb the other workstations around me.  It clipped onto my belt hook easily and wasn't cumbersome at all to carry around.  It also stands conveniently on adesk as the picture shows.  If the first one I received had worked as well as this one does then I would give a 5-star review.  The customer service as well as the integrity of this seller to satisfy customers is very impressive though. If you're seriously considering buying this speaker then I recommend you do so.  You won't be disappointed...for long :)  This company is dedicated to your satisfaction and they put their money (or product in this case) where their mouth is to prove it by sending me one for free.",2015-07-18

The finish / feel of the device far surpassed my expectations - the whole speaker has a quality feel to it that you wouldn't expect for a $20 &#34;made in china&#34; gadget. The speaker is a little smaller in diameter than a can of soda and half as tall (so fairly small and easy to carry around). The rubber grip around the outside is very grippy and has a soft feel to it. The bluetooth worked flawlessly with my iPhone 6, very easy to pair, and never dropped connection once. The sound of this speaker is great, probably a 8/10 (for speakers in this category). The sound was fairly balanced, had better bass than you would expect and great high-end. The bass seemed to sound best when it was sitting on top of a solid surface like a table - that way the bass could vibrate and interact with the surface to enhance the sound. Seemed to lack a little in the middle range, but that's a good thing for speakers of this size anyway.<br /><br />The only downside is that the speaker doesn't have  &#34;skip forward&#34; or &#34;skip backward&#34; buttons. This would be very easy to add - seeing as there's already play/pause, volume up, and volume down buttons. Without skip track buttons you have to use your music device to change the song, which is sort of annoying when you're using this at the beach, or by the pool when you would normally have your phone tucked away.<br /><br />Overall I would buy this again.

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation.<br /><br />This speaker  is very thin (about 1\\"") and a convenient size for travel (7.5\\"" x 5\\"".) The plastic handle rotates completely around the speaker. You can adjust the angle of the speaker simply by rotating the handle to whatever position suits you. This type of handle won't be perfect for some people though. I have seen this speaker slide on the surface it is on since there are no rubber pads on the bottom of the speaker to give it grip. The handle does make it convenient for a grab and go though... and it does get the speaker at a nice listening angle.<br /><br />All the controls are on the top of the speaker: on/off, volume down, play/pause/handsfree/, volume up. The volume up button gives you a short beep to let you know when you've reached maximum volume. All the various prompts you get are tones rather than voice prompts.<br /><br />On the back of the speaker is a flap that covers the AUX in port, Micro USB charging port and a reset button. An AUX cable is provided as well as a USB to Micro USB charging cable.<br /><br />The speaker has a 2000mAh Li-ion battery that will give you about 6 hours of playing time. Charging takes about 2-3 hours.<br /><br />It's a nice looking little speaker. The sound is about what you'd expect out of a speaker at this price. There are two drivers on the front and a passive bass radiator to help enhance bass a bit. This also has an IPX4 rating which means it is capable of withstanding splashes of water from any direction. So although it is not completely waterproof, it will be protected somewhat if you get caught in the rain.",2015-05-15

I also have the newer version of the MB 42s. You can pick these MB42s up for about 59 bucks a pair. If you can find another pair of speakers that can match the sound of these go for it. However I can tell you I have owned speakers like Klipschs that run 10 thousand dollars. If you even go as low as the klipsch 81s ( 1000 a pair vinyl wrapped) they still don't make a difference in the quality of sound! All you need to do is add a 6&#34; or 8&#34; sub for under 100 dollars. With this combination a grand total of about 150 bucks you have a killer system! This system will be with you many years. Easy to move and set up. It is amazing what the Micca engineers can do with the 4&#34; woofer and this dome tweeter. Accurate lows to 40hz and highs beyond what the human ear can hear well above 20khz! Look all you want but if your ready to buy a fantastic set if speakers for 59 bucks a pair the Micca MB42s won't let you down. High quality low price.,2015-04-26

RCA to RCA Cable,Electronics,5,2,2,N,Y,Magic,"I've never believed that a mere cable could play such a huge part in the sound of my equipment. I was so wrong. This cable literally saved my whole hifi setup. Let me explain. So I spent months researching and purchasing a new turntable (orbit uturn), phono preamp (schiit mani), headphone amp (schiit Asgard 2) and multiple headphones AKG Q701 & Grado SR325e). I already had rca cables and figured that even if they were sub par, it probably wouldn't make that much difference. So everything eventually arrived, I plugged it all in cranked up the headphones with the tonearm still in its rest and holy crap it was a cacophony of buzzing, hum and MULTIPLE radio stations. Even when I played records I could still hear all of this stuff especially in the intimate, quiet parts. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I tried switching outlets/ isolating/moving the equipment around but when I moved the cables they acted as an antenna and the radio signals got LOUDER. I had some &#34;better&#34; Monster rca cables around and thought they might help but no such luck. I spent weeks continuing to move gear around, pouring through forums for a hint of what to do and stumbled upon these cables. I did a little research, ordered them and long story short after I plugged them in ALL THE NOISE WAS GONE. Disappeared. I was shocked. Not only did it get rid of all of the junk, it brought much more clarity and punch and definition to the recordings but theyre worth the price alone for the RF rejection. I couldn't be happier. If you are wondering if these really do what they advertise and aren't just &#34;another cable&#34;, they are.",2015-02-01

It does exactly what I wanted it for which was giving better speaker phone capability to my iPhone. A side benefit is that it also is very nice for music. The speaker is small so don't expect huge speaker sound but it doesn't sound like your typical cheap plastic extension speakers sold for portable music players. This output is full and quite impressive and the speaker feels solid. As an example, I like to use some apps on my phone to play guitar. There are amplifier &#34;modeling&#34; apps that basically give you a huge selection of amplifers and accessories etc. that you can use through an external interface that you plug your guitar and headphones into. I have these apps on my iPhone and iPad. Up until now, I have only used headphones because whenever I tried using some extension speakers, it didn't sound up to par. With the Soundblock, I can actually use it and the guitar sounds good along with the other apps I use (drum machine apps, backing track apps etc.). I like it and would buy it again and will probably buy some as gifts.",2015-04-06

Looking at it alone, it has some great features and works well, but when comparing it to its predecessor those features seem inferior.  The change from an OLED to a traditional LCD screen allows for use of more colors, but that's not important on a basic MP3 player, and screen readability is sacrificed as a result.

Several of our samsung devices, which can be charged by any other USB port, do not recognize this power strip and won't charge off of the onboard USB ports. This means we loose outlets for those devices which is less than ideal. Tripp Lite still makes a quality product in terms of safety and durability, and this has been serving me for over a year now without any other problems, but this is simply poorly engineered and is out-of-date with today's standards. --------  First off, I'm a big fan of Tripp Lite products, so when it comes to surge protectors, they are my go-to brand. Cheaper brands tend to fall short of their own specs and, in some cases, are plagued with quality control issues that can lead to equipment loss and/or fires. I've never had a single problem with any Tripp Lite product and I own many.  The main reason I picked this little guy up is because it is easily mountable to a coffee table that blocks an outlet without having to drill anything. Now I dont have to crawl underneath every time I want to plug or unplug something.  I couldn't mount this to the upper portion of my coffee table as the surface of the table was too thick by about one milometer. Fortunately, it's a two-tiered table and I had planned on attaching it to the lower (and thinner) surface all along, so it was not an issue for me. But if you've got a thick desk or table, this might not work.  Also, the USB ports max out at 2.1 amps, whereas some of the newer devices are capable of charging up to 2.4 amps. Not a huge deal as I typically charge my device overnight which is more than enough even at 1 amp, but due to this and the table thickness issue I deducted one star. Still a great product and I am a happy owner. Highly recommended.",2015-02-25

There's a high-pitched 'squealing' every once in a while. (see video)  I think this is the bluetooth working, because when the bluetooth is off (and you're just listening to it through the 3.5mm cable) there's no squeal.<br />✅ Very soft, comfortable earphones.  Covers the ears completely which is a huge plus.<br />✅ Can talk on the phone with the them (note: audio quality is decent for a phone conversation.  I wouldn't use these for studio recording. See video.)<br />✅ Nice folks at Ausdom. They actually sent me these headphones to test and video review.<br />✅ Folds up compact and fits in my laptop bag beautifully.<br /><br />Cons:<br />🍅 Depending on what listing you're looking at, it's pricey for what you get (mainly the high-pitched squealing and fuzzy feedback you get when it's in bluetooth mode)... if you can find an Amazon listing of these for under $45 or $40, it's worth it.<br /><br />Summary: 4/5 stars. Very comfortable, look awesome, long battery life, and they fold up nicely.",2015-05-07

So if you have computers, cell phones, tablets, camera batteries, and other devices to charge, you absolutely need something like this to travel with. Just add an adapter, and all of your devices have an outlet to charge from.<br /><br />So what's not to like about this one? For some reason, Monster decided that you need to have the a bright blue LED suitable for a Christmas tree in an arctic climate to illuminate the outlet. Imagine trying to sleep in a European hotel room with such a thing running, especially if that outlet is located right next to your bed. Blue LED light, like green LED light, is even worse than amber or red if you are trying to sleep.<br /><br />One of my tricks in traveling is to carry Frog Tape to cover all the unwanted LED lights in a hotel room and get some sleep. This one is so bright that several layers of Frog Tape don't cover it up. Why waste all the electric power? Why should a power outlet strip have an LED that you can't turn off, when all the things you are likely to plug into it also have LEDs you can't turn off? What a waste of resources!",2015-05-29

In my limited FM testing in Central New Jersey (~35 mi straight line from NYC), this antenna worked decidedly better than the Terk AM/FM+. Signal strength and clarity of FM stereo was improved as was the ability to receive HD Radio broadcasts (Full disclosure: I am an engineer for iBiquity Digital and work on HD Radio receivers). I also tested this antenna with the amplifier power disconnected and the performance suffered noticeably. The 2x cost of the Tower vs the AM/FM+ is definitely worth it for a user looking to improve performance from a stationary indoor installation in an area with decent coverage.<br /><br />As for complaints of &#34;no better than the included antenna:&#34; none of these small indoor antennas will perform as well as a properly installed, permanent outdoor antenna; bigger is simply better - and directional better still - for pulling in distant FM stations in the middle of nowhere. Rural users unfortunately will not see any improvement without an attic or roof mounted antenna. I use the Stellar Labs Outdoor Omnidirectional FM Antenna for camping and it is probably a good inexpensive first step for a rural user to try and would likely only improve from an amplifier.<br /><br />I use the Terk AM Advantage for AM, but did not compare Tower vs Advantage due to a lack of proper connectors for any of my AM radios. Advantage is a great antenna though for the serious AM listener (in my case, no cable TV so AM radio is my source for Mets baseball). I can't see how this non-tuneable, powered antenna could have comparable performance, but I could be wrong. I will update if I get the right widgets to compare the two antennas.",2015-07-16

In doing so I found out its beginning with Neil Young, the Kickstarter and what it was hoping to achieve with its sound quality.  I have to say at that point I was definitely intrigued because the idea that music would sound different and so much better on this player versus the ones I already owned seemed hard to believe.<br /><br />When it arrived the packaging is the first thing to notice.  On the exterior box they have printed accolades from multiple highly regarded musicians touting the sound quality of Pono.  Then you open the box and inside is another box, but this one is made of bamboo and has a slide off top with the logo printed on it. Finally inside of that you have the player, USB cord and instructions all nicely packed and presented.<br /><br />The button functions on Pono are  basic; play/pause and volume up and down.  Everything else is managed via the touch screen, which although not as large as I would like it is still easy to use.  It has an output for hook up to an audio system, a plug for headphones and a usb connection for charging and transferring files. The size and shape is going to be different that most players out there.  It’s triangular which is great for setting it down as it won’t roll or slide away from you, but it is a bit bulky to have in your pocket.<br /><br />I read over the quick instructions and then set about downloading Pono World Music to my computer.  Once that was completed I decided the best way for me to compare the music quality was to purchase a few flac files of songs I already owned in MP3 quality.  The MP3 songs were already loaded on my iPod and Panasonic music player which made comparison easy.  Once this was done I listened to the same songs alternatively on each player using the same headphones and then I played them each through my Harman Kardon home stereo system.  As I am no Audiophile I cannot explain in technical terms how the Pono player performed so, so much better than the others, but it did.  With the songs I purchased and played via Pono, it was almost like they were new and different.  Side by side there was so much more detail and sound that I obviously wasn’t getting with the MP3 versions, but even with the MP3 versions being played on the Pono there was still a noticeable difference.<br /><br />Overall when it comes down to deciding whether Pono is right for you I would base it off of one thing – the sound quality.  While I have been happy in the past and probably still will be with my iPod and other music player, had the Pono been available when I made my initial purchases I definitely would have given it consideration.  For me though the compactness and lower cost of the alternatives suit me even if the sound is not as impressive.ow the Pono player performed so, so much better than the others, but it did.

Because I can't recall an HDMI cable ever letting me down. Of course, you can get similar performance from a more 'generic' wire, priced a few dollars less but, if you care about looks, possibly because you are planning to use your cable in full view (with a phone or tablet) rather than at the back of your equipment, then the extra dollars may be dollars well spent. The nylon braiding ensures that your cable won't tangle and it's pretty but, of course, you wire is more rigid because of it.

I haven't had any trouble with it and it does what it says it does.

And once I do that to fill in a form on a linked website to get the extension. The form on their website has a spot for the review text, the star rating given, and some instructions include the following lines of text:<br /><br />&#34;The star rating of your review has no impact on your extended warranty.&#34;<br /><br />but then<br /><br />&#34;7) Complimentary extended warranties will only be given for reviews that are deemed helpful and constructive.

Now, granted nowhere do they actually say leave them a good review or a review of a certain number of stars. But who would give them a negative or even mediocre review and then turn around and ask them for a gift? And would such reviews be considered helpful and constructive? I don't know. I believe though this is effectively buying good customer reviews with a small bonus, which ought to reflect poorly on them and is against Amazon's review guidelines.<br /><br />Again, the device is decent, but just keep the above in mind while looking at the reviews.",2015-08-16

I did not purchase this through Amazon, but direct from Schiit.  But I'm anxious to leave a review and since I'm an Amazon Prime member AND Amazon sells the Magni 2 this seems like the perfect place to leave a review.<br /><br />Second, I am using this Magni 2 in conjunction with a Modi 2 DAC from Schiit, and all is hooked up to a pair of Emotiva Airmotiv 5S self-powered desktop speakers, and a pair of Sennheiser HD600 headphones.  I've owned the Sennheisers for a few months, often listening to them on my Marantz CD6005 CD player, and the Schiit / Emotiva items for about three weeks.<br /><br />I feel very confident and certain that my music listening experience at the computer has been dramatically enhanced by the addition of the Magni 2, Modi 2 and Airmotiv 5S speakers.  My Sennheiser HD600's were already a known factor thanks to many hours of use in conjunction with the very good Marantz CD6005 player.  I can highly recommend the player!<br /><br />Because of the Marantz I at least had an expectation of what I hoped the addition of the Schiit equipment would have on my computer listening habits. (FYI: I'm using iTunes with ALAC encoded tracks)  My thinking was that there was a clear difference in sound quality when I listened with my HD600's on the Marantz CD6005 vs. listening straight from the headphone jack on the back of my iMac.  Even with ALAC files the sound in my HD600's was thinner everywhere, and spatial separation and location of instruments was muddied compared to CDs played in the Marantz.<br /><br />Attached to the computer and run for 24-hours (for any potential benefit 'break-in' may have) I selected a number of very well known tracks across a spectrum of music (some classical, mostly Mozart and Beethoven, some classic rock  (the recently remastered Led Zeppelin works) and plenty of broadly-painted alternative (remastered Sisters of Mercy, remastered Cure, etc.), plugged in the headphones and began listening.  It was everything I could have asked for, especially at the price point paid.<br /><br />I'm a realist... I understand that the pursuit of music reproduction quality can generally always be made better by the liberal application of money.  But it becomes a truly diminishing return in my opinion.  I wanted better sound quality at a price my checking account would appreciate and that I would actually hear.  The Magni 2 and Modi 2 hit the mark.<br /><br />Bass plunged deeper and was more taut.. precise.  Mids and voices sprung forth with greater definition and clarity, but not to be confused with becoming too forward.  And highs.... cymbal splashes and certain brass instruments... shimmered and shined instead of getting smeared. Almost like the difference between a RAW image file and a compressed and lossy JPEG.<br /><br />At some point while listening to a few classical music pieces I thought I heard pops and clicks of some sort.  My immediate reaction was that it was related to the recording itself or could be something wrong with all this new equipment (or even the creation of the ALAC file from the CD).  But repeating the offending segments over and over I soon discovered I was simply hearing the sounds that come from musicians playing their instruments.  The fingers striking or sliding over strings and other incidental noises were suddenly clear where previously they were lost and muddled.<br /><br />So... could I get even more out of my ALAC files if I had purchased a more expensive Schiit headphone amp and DAC?  Probably.  I'm certain they are fine equipment with different/improved qualities that impact the playback of music from a computer.  I know I'm sold on what I purchased!  But again, this is about dollars and cents and value.  I feel like I have done very well on the value-scale and that I imagine I could be very happy with these items and never feel compelled to move up in the product lines.<br /><br />As an aside.. the Airmotivs are also very good!  For an extra $50 over the 4S models you get twice the power (50 vs 25-watts) and only a slightly bigger cabinet.  Spend the extra $50.<br /><br />Now.. for all this praise I didn't hit the full 5-stars for one reason and one reason only:  the internal components and the external case of my Magni 2 aren't quite perfectly aligned.  Upon receipt it was obvious the volume control & power button were not centered in the drilled-out holes in the aluminum case.  Yes; it's only an aesthetic issue, but it's annoying.  They are clearly shifted to the right and me being weird about that sort of thing I notice it every time I turn on the Magni 2.  Also, the Coax connector on the back is slightly bent (not perpendicular to the back of the unit), while all the other items (switches and RCA in- and outputs) are fine.<br /><br />I did immediately email Schiit regarding the coax issue even though I have no use for it (I input by USB and would most likely use the Toslink in other instances).  I even included a picture so they could see it.  They assured me it wouldn't impact its use if I ever needed it.  Naturally, I saved that e-mail.<br /><br />But I felt I had to dock the one star for this clear miss on quality control.  Both issues are readily obvious and should have been caught during any final, visual inspection.  The Modi 2, on the other hand, looks perfect.er the 4S models you get twice the power (50 vs 25-watts) and only a slightly bigger cabinet.

This weakness is known or a long time.Why do you still sell them?,2015-03-10

Works iPhone and Android - Amazon Orange",Electronics,5,5,6,N,N,... never had a pair of Bluetooth ear buds quite like this. You can see they are extremely uniquely ...,"I've never had a pair of Bluetooth ear buds quite like this. You can see they are extremely uniquely shaped and the earpieces are in a angled down position which I like because they actually stay in my ears better.  I also like the little yellow Shields they have on them to help keep them in place and to keep them from going too far in my ear. Both earbuds are marked left or right so you know where they go, That can come in handy for anyone especially someone who is not tech savvy or has never worn earbuds before as it makes it easier to put them on so you don't try sticking them in the wrong ear and either hurt yourself or have them feel uncomfortable. All of the buttons are on the right ear bud. The power button is on the side that faces your ear. They're extremely light and wearing them for a long period of time does not bother my ears. If I do want to take them out I just laid around my neck and sort of hook them so they do not fall off. It comes with a USB charger which I love because that means I can plug it into my laptop my desktop any of the outlets we have in our house because they have a USB port and I have a surge protector that I can also charged in that has USB ports. I also have the same type of charger port on other devices so if I lose this one or am out and do not have the one that came with this I know I have an extra one either in my car or I'm sure that one of my friends are bound to have that type of charger in their house because it is such a common type. The sound is ridiculously crystal clear. The sound also goes with the volume of your phone or you can use the volume buttons that are on the right earbud. There's also a mic on this so it's not just great for music you can also use it as a hands-free headset for when you're driving, doing something that you need to use both hands for, or if you are like me and just simply do not want to hold a phone to your head. It is extremely simple  to pair to your phone. Simply press and hold the power button until it's blinking red and green, go to your settings, go to Bluetooth, wait until you see fit acoustics listed, and click on it so it pairs. After this it should say connected and all you need to do is turn it on and off when you need to use it. I really think is a cool feature is when you power it on it tells you power on when you turn it off it says powering off. Not to mention the colors are practically that of my favorite football team which to me is a bonus and this headset is definitely unique and awesome. I could not ask for a better one. These are absolutely my very own honest opinions after having received and try this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased an honest review.utton until it's blinking red and green, go to your settings, go to Bluetooth, wait until you see fit acoustics listed, and click on it so it pairs.

This was purchased as a replacement power supply for a Zooka ZS-740 Pitching Machine. Minus one star for not including any default tip in the package, but I understand that is to enable customization for what you need to hook up and power. I would still like to see perhaps the most common size adapter tip included, then you could purchase others should you need. At Radio Shack they let you select a tip as 'included' when you buy an Enercell adapter such as this. I purchased the matching tip at Radio Shack for about $4 on sale and it's been working well. It is nice to be able to use one adapter for different items, as long as they have the same power requirements. In this case, the 15V I needed is fairly limited so the use will be dedicated as far as I can see. So far it has not made my Poweball or Mega Millions numbers hit so I feel a little cheated there. Publisher's Clearinghouse has also not showed up at my door with a giant check, but for a good stable 15V, that performs just over 1000mA as measured by a Fluke 187 this fits the bill.",2015-06-17

So I fired an email off to AC Infinity, only half expecting a reply, as it is so common to get very little response from companies. However AC Infinity were brilliant, even though I was planning on spending less than $100, every email I sent was rapidly replied to with detailed information - including photos (I was wanting to know if the power supply supported 240V - it does). So no faults on pre purchase delivery.<br /><br />Secondly I had read that at low speeds there was fan noise, which made me nervous about buying. Again AC Infinity were straight up that their old stock had an issue, but they had revised the fan controller, and the new ones were ok - but they suggested waiting 2 months until the new stock was at Amazon.<br /><br />So I duly purchased and Amazon dispatched to New Zealand, where they stayed in the box for a few months (moving house etc) I finally unboxed them, and was impressed with the finish and build quality - they are beautifully made units. Alas once I installed them I noticed they had the dreaded low speed rattle.<br /><br />I let AC Infinity know, not expecting to much. But again I was delighted at their prompt response, requesting a bit more information which allowed them to confirm the units I had received from Amazon were old stock. Unprompted, they offered to send me some new units at no cost (not even the postage to New Zealand) which arrived in only a matter of days. These units were installed, and they work brilliantly. Quiet, and very effective at moving air and dropping cabinet temperatures.<br /><br />I cannot recommend these units and AC Infinity enough, the units are excellent and the customer service even more so. Would buy again without hesitation.<br /><br />Thanks AC Infinity!",2015-08-16

19884931,R1ML4QH3BHHHT4,B00PEU9CFA,420171236,"Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7BK SonicPro Over-Ear High-Resolution Audio Headphones, Black",Electronics,4,473,489,N,N,Guide to the MSR7 with Comparisons to top competitors,"Audio Technica has crafted a pair of headphones that might make you second guess your pair of MX50s, or any other headphone in this price range.<br /><br />Here is a guide to the ATH-MSR7's examining what they do right and where they fall short.<br /><br />Build/Appearance<br />Pros:<br />+ Very &#34;public&#34; friendly (GREAT looking set of headphones)<br />+ Matte finish on the aluminum housing and nice colored accents as well as chrome touches in several places<br />+ Brushed chrome slider<br /><br />+ Outward bulk is as minimal as it can be given the size, no strange gaps, stay pretty flushed to your head<br />+ Good durability and flexibility<br />+ They may slide a bit, but they stay on your head if you're walking, turning head quickly.<br />+ Aluminum casing around the drivers and metal headband look and feel impressive<br />+ Balanced weight, no manufacturing oddities<br />+ Earphones twist (the correct way, unlike QC25 which fold outwards if you are wearing them around your neck -.-)<br />+ Large adjustment range to suit different sized heads<br />+ Tolerances are all tight and flush<br />+ Cable has tight fit into left headphone<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Strange decision to put (LEFT/RIGHT) on outside of headphones. Not that unappealing though...<br /><br />- Lots of creaking plastic when expanding headphones (everything except driver housing and slider is plastic)<br />- Not foldable<br />- Squirmy cable with large jack housing<br />- Weight (290g) - not such a big deal<br />- Adjustment slider is a bit stiff<br /><br />Comfort<br />Pros:<br />+Earpads are large, fit all the way around your ear<br />+Earpad depth is DECENT, some might look for a little more breathing room - ears are VERY close to drivers<br />+ No sharp parts or anything like that<br />+ Just enough padding on the headband which wraps around a good portion of it<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Earpads are not memory foam - they are soft, but why not make them even softer?<br />- OK the headband. It's not curved correctly. Out of the box it pressed down onto the top point of your head. Flex it a bit, break it in. NO ISSUES<br />- OK the clamping pressure. Again, out of the box it is a bit irritating. Because the earpads are so large, the pressure from the bottom of the earpads was getting to the top of my jaw after about an hour. Again, flex it, break it in, open it, close it, open it. *lots of creaking* It will work out. STILL, pressure is above average for sure.<br />- Again, 290 oz is a good amount of weight on someone's head.<br /><br />Sound Quality - I'm going to try to keep this simple and unbiased<br />+ DETAILS. Lots of details.<br />+ Impressive Clarity, no muffling of vocals<br />+ Soundstage is impressively wide for a closed back headphone - all instruments and vocals have their own &#34;space&#34;<br />+ Natural and relatively neutral.<br />+ Reaches high and low: Good bass, mid and treble presence<br />+ Tight, focused bass that can drop fairly low<br /><br />Cons:<br />- NOT a relaxing headphone. Ears seem to work hard with these on, focusing in and out to deal with those upfront mids and trebles especially at higher volumes<br />- Bass is not for bassheads or for anyone who is looking for dynamic bass response<br />- Because it is closer to neutral than most consumer headphones, it won't sound as full, rather music sounds more separate and clear<br />- Flirts with sibilance in the treble - what's this mean? S's sound a bit raspy and sharp<br /><br />Neutral - Personal Preference<br />= Vocals and treble are very much upfront<br />= Mids are emphasized<br />= Bass is only present when it needs to be<br />=Treble is not smoothed out (more sharp than soothing)<br /><br />Isolation/Sound Leakage - A short summary<br />- Not great. Isolation average at best. It muffles outside noise, but nowhere nears cancels it. Sound leakage is decent. Better than the QC25's, about the same as UE6000. It's what you expect, not spectacularly worse or better.<br /><br />Accessories<br />= 3 cables: short, longer, longest. The short one is for your average consumer, comes with inline remote that comes with mic and ability to play/pause, NO VOLUME. Works on Android/iOS<br />- Fake leather...Vinyl? well. It's a bag. And that's a shame. It should be a hard or semi-hard carrying case at this price point. It's a nice bag, feels good - the headphone fits fine, but it's still just a bag.<br /><br />Comparisons<br />Sony MDR-1A ($300):<br />Boy these looks similar. Well, the Sony is more comfortable by a long shot w/ memory foam earpads, lighter, smaller footprint and no clamping force/headband issues. (it's incredibly comfortable vs. mildly comfortable). The Sony is plastic all the way around though it is arguably better designed. Why? The cable is designed so that it does not run up on your shoulder. The cable has this neat twisting input and most importantly the plastics don't creak. That being said: The MSR7 is arguably more impressive to hold and look at with its matte aluminum driver casings and sturdy build. Sound quality is entirely subjective. They may look the same, but they act differently. Sony is less neutral, much smoother and more relaxing. It lacks the details of the MSR7 and the vocals are a lot more subdued. The bass is very present, and fairly well behaved. The treble and midrange are definitely not as upfront.<br />Recommendation: Rap, Metal, R&B, Hard Rock listeners go with the Sony's. Classical, Acoustic, Alternative, Indie: Go with MSR7<br /><br />Bose QC25 ($300):<br />Just to shorten this, we'll say that the QC25 is about as comfortable as the MDR-1A, they remind me a lot of each other (w/o having had both at the same time). All plastic again. Very light, memory foam, etc. Comes with semi-hard carrying case. Noise cancelling as you well know is very impressive (INCREDIBLE on a plane, not as good with ind. voices). The MSR7 has better clarity, better soundstage, more present mid range and treble. The QC25's are pretty well balanced, with a decent bass (close to MSR7, not as refined) and good mid and treble range, They are still much more relaxing a listen. They are a jack of all trades but a master of one.<br />Recommendation: If you plan to wear your headphones in public a lot (loud places), get the QC25, no question. Otherwise, MSR7 sound is more detailed.<br /><br />Audio Technica MX50 (~$160 at time of review):<br />Here we go. The younger brother (kinda). This one is tough. Well they are similar in many ways. The MSR7 has slightly improved earpads (softer). Clamping force is a little stronger on MSR7. Otherwise, comfort is pretty similar. Build is similar, except you have aluminum instead of plastic, frankly the MSR7 look a lot more &#34;grown up.&#34; Weight is similar. The MX50's fold up (That's nice.) MX50 cord is a little better (who cares at this point?). OK, sound: MX50 has more bass, MSR7 has a little more detail and better soundstage. While the MSR7 bass is a little more refined (less boomy) the MX50 bass gives a much more dynamic, better overall impression. MX50 mids and treble not as forward as MSR7, so more relaxing listen.<br /><br />Logitech UE6000 (Discontinued, available for $115)<br />UE6000, again, is more comfortable. Less so than the Sony's and Bose headphones, but the lighter weight body makes the difference here. Clamping force is also a relief. Overall, the sound is worse than the MSR7. It's not as detailed and much less clear. The bass is just a tad bit more pronounced, but given the lack of clarity, well, it's not worth that loss. Build quality is good...it's plastic again...fabric carrying case (not a bag), comes with headphone slitter which is nice. I should say came with it, these are discontinued.<br /><br />UPDATE: Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 comparison<br />I got my hands on the new Momentum 2.0 and 2.0 Wireless at this years SXSW trade show. The MSR7's and Momentum's were positioned a few yards from each other, so a few awkward walks back and forth gave me a good idea of how these stack up to each other. The new Momentum's (especially wireless) are about as close to perfect as you can get for a portable consumer headphone. They are supremely comfortable, have great sound, and are quite stylish. They isolate noise better than the MSR7's, and even weigh a little less. I would argue that they have slightly better build quality with a leather headband and no creaking plastics. The sound? Well they both sound great. The Momentum's dig a little deeper in the bass which makes them a little more dynamic, but they do not separate sound as well as the MSR7's. They are not as clear and unfront, they are a more relaxing, balanced listen. But then there is the price. It's $350 ($500 for wireless) vs. $250. That's pretty significant. The original Momentum's started at $370 and are now at around $200, so I would suspect a similar decrease. That might take a while though, so reach into your wallet and see what you are willing to spend. Oh. They fold up and come with a nice carrying case as well...<br /><br />Recommendation: I would buy the Momentum's if you have the money. They are just incredible comfortable and sound really good. If you don't care about the fancy features offered by the Wireless version, and strictly listen to piano or acoustic based music, I would consider getting the MSR7's.<br /><br />Note: The Wireless version did a GOOD job cancelling out noise. Better than average, worse than Bose. The bluetooth was pretty skippy though. I think they used an 5s if I remember correctly. Might just be an isolated issue. You can connect a cord to the wireless Momentum's if you want.<br /><br />Others to recommend in similar category:<br />Sennheiser Momentum 1 ($188 at time of review) and Momentum 2 ($350) and Wireless ($500)<br />Bowers and Wilkins P5 II ($300) and P7 ($400)<br />Bang and Olufsen BeoPlay H6 ($400)<br />NAD VISO HP50 ($300)<br />Denon AH-D600 (~$300)<br />V-Moda M100 ($300)<br />and many more...<br /><br />Summary: Beautiful design and nice matte black aluminum finish marred by some creaky plastics. The comfort level is a notch below &#34;good&#34; because of the weight (290g), clamping force, and headband pressure. Accessories are OK, 3 cables of varying length and just a cloth bag. Sound quality is excellent, though not relaxing. The mids and treble are very forward and border on fatiguing, especially at higher volumes. That being said, details are excellent, soundstage is impressive, bass does a good job, and nothing sounds unnatural. Isolation and sound leakage are nothing special.<br /><br />No point to recommend these to you, because I do not know who &#34;you&#34; are. Facts are facts and preferences are preferences. But these are good headphones. They do a lot of things well. I hope if you read this, you know which direction to go in.<br /><br />Here are some other things:<br />***These headphones were tested on a Dell XPS 13 (2014) and LG G3. No amp. Various sources (Google Music, Soundcloud, Youtube, &#34;Hi-Res&#34; audio, Surround sound tests, bass tests, etc.)<br /><br />Please feel free to comment and ask questions. I really do hope this helped. If it did, please give me some credit for this exhausting review.pretty well balanced, with a decent bass (close to MSR7, not as refined) and good mid and treble range, They are still much more relaxing a listen.

I use these batteries in wireless mics about 3 times a week, and its great to see the actual battery voltage, and when (usually a year or more) I have should replace the batteries, as the overall voltage goes down.  The Max e Pro batteries are great, fit in all of my gear, and charge up fast  I was a little weary of the batteries being only 1900mah, compared to my other ansmann batteries at 2800mah, but after 3 church services, the readout on mics still said 3.5 hours, which puts them in the 10 hour total time category .

The replacement's sound quality was also bad especially in left ear again. It could have been good but the sound kept cutting in and out sounding muffled then loud then just okay. It was best with noise canceling on but it did not compare to these B & W's.  I LOVE them and kept them. All I really care about is sound quality and they must stay in and be comfy. These are VERY comfy to my ears. All they do is insert inside your ear, that loop never touches you so I don't understand how they can't be comfortable to some. Maybe they have the wrong size rubber attachment?<br />The sound was better than the Bose by far and these were less $. I even read this statement in many reviews online. It is true! They don't have noise canceling but from my comparison, it didn't matter at all because it made NO difference in the quality. The only time NC is good is if you are traveling and want to quiet your ears without any music on. It has nothing to do with sound of music.<br />Plus the Bose noise cancel had that big cumbersome battery pack that would die often , so who wants one more thing to have to do and haul around. I just want to plug them in and listen.  Also, if the battery ran out & you had to listen with out NC on, it sounded terrible. You could listen just fine but the quality is crap without that battery on!!!<br />These B&W's are super light weight too so they don't pull out of your head or need a clip to clamp onto your shirt to protect from pulling out.<br /><br />I researched earbuds to death before I ordered anything and was willing to pay up to $300 for amazing sound quality. These were the only ones that I was happy with. I had Shure before these but don't waste your time with that brand. They died after 11 months and the quality was not great. I paid $250 for those.

The new remote works great and I am very pleased. Once I was sure the new remote worked, I took the old one apart (one screw under the batteries, then pry it apart carefully). I noticed the keys I used most had some kind of sticky substance on the back of the rubber buttons. I washed the rubber button pad, and after drying it thoroughly, put the remote back together and slapped some batteries in it. The old remote works almost as good as the new one, so now, I have two remotes for my TV. Moral of the story: If you're not worried about potentially trashing your remote, take it apart and clean it.

This is louder than I expected. It arrived sooner than I expected. I like that it has a built in radio. I can hear this all over the house and my home isn't small. My 10 year old hooked it up so that's how easy it is to install. The only two small things I don't like is that it has to be controlled separately from the tv, so when you want the volume down while watching tv you  have to lower it on the tv remote and the speaker remote unless you only want to use the speaker. The other minor thing is that the blue light flashes constantly in standby mode. That probably won't bother most people. But other than that this thing is awesome. Very good looking, bluetooth works great, it even speaks to you and tells you what it's doing when you push the buttons, for example: searching, bluetooth mode, standby, radio, etc. I think it's the best looking one I've ever seen. How many have you seen that have a lit up screen on the front and a radio? I think you will be pleased if you buy one.",2015-01-03

They weren't as good as regular Harmon Kardon in-ear which made carrying the extra weight and the little box ridiculous.  The noise cancellation is sub-par at best.  I actually get more noise cancellation from regular in-ear headphones than these.  The cords are long and the box doesn't have a clip. The sound is o.k. but then why even get these, just get regular in-ear!  The ear bud part is also very heavy, they weren't uncomfortable to wear just annoying. The one good thing about these is that they can be charged with a micro-usb cord; that means no AAA batteries to carry.   Overall though, I'm very disappointed in Harmon Kardon for this hot mess.",2015-08-10

Here is my review. I will try to keep this review as short and concise as possible.  Pros: Offers a listening experience that is friendly to all types of music. Bluetooth feature is amazing with connection length extending up to 30 feet. I can connect the headphones to my phone and leave it on my wireless charging mat and walk 25 feet to the kitchen and make food freely without any cable mess. Another good thing is that the wireless features doesn't degrade the sound quality. Battery life last 12 hours and there is an indicator on the headphones itself that shows how much juice is left. Some phones with newer OS even have a dedicated battery indicator on the phone itself. A nice little touch. These headphones are also extremely comfortable. I can wear them for hours and hours. Glasses doesn't cause any discomfort. Last but not least these headphones, in my opinion, looks really nice. The Titanium color I got with the matte finish helps prevent fingerprint marks as well as make it not so flashy when compared to the glossy counterparts.  Cons: These headphones are expensive. I'd say these headphones are probably not the best bang for the buck in terms of tying sound quality with price. These headphones also won't work without charges on the battery. Even on wired mode. On wired mode you will get about 20 hours of use and on wireless mode, as mentioned above, you will get about 12 hours of use. Luckily it charges relatively quickly. The headphones may be really comfortable but the build material doesn't qualify its price tag. The headphones is primarily made up of plastic which is disappointing at this price point but materials choices didn't ruin the comfort levels or the durability levels.  Edit (8/25/2015): With the recent price drop, the cost went down to $240. At this current price range these pair of bluetooth headphones offer a much better bang for the buck than the previous $380. I'll also raisemy rating from 4 to 4.5 stars (round up to 5 since Amazon doesn't allow adjustments lower than 1) due to the price drop as well as I realized that after 100 hours of burning in the headphones, I noticed a slight yet significant improvement in sound quality.",2015-07-01

I did my research at AT&T's website to find out that it is indeed newer and it is also compatible (I have Uverse through Frontier Communications). So I ordered one. After quick shipping from the seller, I found this remote to be outstanding! Not only was it the easiest remote I have ever setup with my TV, it is exceedingly better than the previous version.<br /><br />As you can tell by the photo some buttons have been repositioned for maximum functionality and easier use. For example: instead of a tiny and hard to find &#34;Recorded TV&#34; button for the DVR there is a large green &#34;Recordings&#34; button in the middle of the whole remote. And all of the white buttons illuminate for quicker access in a darkened room which is optimal for TV enjoyment. The remote also has a less cluttered appeal as well. Plus it just has a better feel in the hand. Batteries are included in all of the remotes I received with pull tabs inserted, to be removed by myself upon opening.<br /><br />I highly recommend purchasing this remote.

My review is just my experience. I must say these earbuds look very nice, immensely aesthetically pleasing. The black and white look just got me in -- everything has a nice, stylish look, from the linen bag to the braided cord and wooden phones themselves. The cord does, unfortunately, have the habit of tangling-up quite easily, but nothing that can't be sorted out. As far as the sound quality is concerned, it is good, but not great, they are a little bass-y for my own tastes. The highs are muted and get distort slightly when you reach the high notes, however the bass and quality of sounds for midtones makes up for it.<br /><br />The noise isolation is good too. These truly cut out the music in the gym that other earphones failed to do. The fit was okay, they don’t slip even while I am working out.

They got destroyed like all my other headphones by my rate terrier.  I searched all over Amazon, and didn't really want to try and justify a $50-$100 purchase for new ones, so I settled on these. I was seriously afraid they would give me bad quality sound considering the price.<br /><br />I received the headset, and immediately loved the look of them.  They look a little nicer than the other HBS-760 branded headsets out there.  The magnets work tremendously well for holding in the buds, the sound gets really loud if you want it to, only downfall to that is they do not isolate the noise from everyone else, they only isolate everyone else's noise from you.  The sound quality is far above par for the price, and far above par for bluetooth.<br /><br />Making and receiving phone calls is good, the sound quality is great.  Before, I would get people asking if they were on speaker phone or on a headset, not with these ones yet.  Listening to music on these is definitely pleasant, and I use them for that more than anything else honestly.

Ever since the day I opened the box. I've put it to great use & take it everywhere I go. The speaker puts out great sound quality and last up to 12 hours. When I first opened the box the battery gave me about 8hours right out the box without charging it. The small size makes it easy to carry around but the hard plastic and rubber body makes it rugged enough for small drops without damaging the unit. The company states its splash proof I have never got it completely wet but have used it in the shower with no worries of getting a bit of water on it. The best test I have ever given my speaker is at the beach where I put it on the sand and after I was done just blew off the sand with no issues or damages to the unit. I would highly recommend the unit to any one looking for a small rugged speaker or something that runs longer. The three things I love about this speaker are:<br /><br />-The size makes it easy to carry around with its small compact body.<br />-The battery life is great compared to other units that give you a max of 4hours.<br />-Sound quality is great for such a small unit I have seen plenty of speakers that cost 5 times the amount this speaker cost and still wont deliver what the Omaker Bluetooth speaker packs.<br />I would rate this item 9.5/10.,2015-05-14

17694808,R1K2EIRNZYM6JC,B00BLG5CSC,816205208,Philips ActionFit Sports Earhook Headphones,Electronics,1,3,4,N,N,Disingenuous advertising looked great.,"I had been searching for headphones specifically designed for use while running, etc., as my experience with headphones in the past had been very frustrating. I naively believed that these headphones would be different, because they explicitly claim to &#34;not slip&#34; and &#34;stay in - always.&#34;<br /><br />Unfortunately, in practice, they are little better than any other ear bud-style headphones. Although they don't actually fall out of your ear, they do not stay in place for more than a few moments unless you remain absolutely still, which is impossible if you're exercising. The sound is quite good when the earphones are positioned correctly, but as I said, they do not remain positioned correctly for more than a short span of time. I am constantly reaching up on both sides in order to push them back into my ears. It is extremely frustrating and detracts from both my listening and my running.<br /><br />The gimmick of &#34;adjustable&#34; that this product touts is also worthless. All the adjustment does is make the band tighter around the ear as a whole, while not ameliorating the main problem: that the &#34;buds&#34; will not stay in the ear.<br /><br />You may as well buy some cheap, $5 unbranded knock-off headphones, because you won't get the sound quality from the earphones unless you are perfectly still, and you can't use them even for a light walk.<br /><br />I have tried everything to make these headphones function as advertised, but nothing works. The clip attached to the cord does not help. I've even tried wrapping the cord around my neck like a noose, in order to reduce the pull of the cord, but the earbuds still fall out of my ears. Of course, I have tried using these headphones with each of the three various sizes of earbuds that are included, but it's just a matter of which one fails to remain in my ear worst. None of them actually work. The only success I've ever had with headphones for exercising with, has been with real, over-ear headphones, so I will return to what works.<br /><br />I wish that I could get a refund for these...so I will return to what works.<br /><br />I wish that I could get a refund for these...",2015-03-07

Apple included the new A8 chip, an 8mp ISight camera, and topped it all off with a new range of color choices.  The A8 chip makes this Ipod the best one yet for gaming, and overall performance.  The camera is also a very nice upgrade to bring the whole experience of the new Ipod touch together.

Amazon won't let me return them (as it's been more than 30 days), so I'm still figuring out the warranty process. I'm waiting to see how long before pair #3 craps out on me. It's a shame because they're great otherwise, and there's a strange lack of quality iPhone headsets on the market - tons of cheap crap, very little to pick from over $30.

The unit itself feels ok, it works well.  When I get into the car and switch it on it connects straight to my phone and the audio is good.  The downside is that the unit cannot be charged while playing due to interference.  There are certain areas that I drive through that cause interference too, I can live with this but not the fact that it cannot be charged while playing.  The interface is a bit clumsy also, there are no raised buttons but you have to swipe the screen at the top and then it lights up - typically this will  inadvertently play or pause.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Mostly good audio<br />- Battery life appears to be pretty good<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Cannot charge the device and listen at the same time - there is a lot of interference when plugged in<br />- On occasion there is interference from &#34;something&#34;, I am not too sure what this is but when I drive through certain areas it sounds like a radio station that is coming out of focus<br />- The controls are not very responsive - it is a flat screen that only seems to light up when you swipe over the play/pause area - there are no raised buttons which makes it difficult to navigate",2015-01-30

I understand that many buyers have had good experiences with it and really wanted to be one of them, but we have gone through two of them now and the product just doesn't work for us. With both the original and the replacement units there was a brief honeymoon period where it worked great, but within a few uses they began cutting out after only a few minutes of use. After only a few minutes of listening there would be a buzzy loud pop and the sound would just stop. If we changed the channel on the base unit it would re-acquire the sound, work for a minute or two and repeat the pop and silence. Each time we changed the base unit channel this would repeat, and once it even stopped searching for a signal entirely. We are returning now for a refund. I wish it would have worked, we could really use it.<br />Update:<br />Even more disappointing, I was charged a $43 restocking fee when I returned the second defective unit. I did search Amazon policies and Help for solutions and when I determined that I had returned both sets within the 30 day time limit I found the place in Help to contact Amazon and requested a phone call. The call was answered quickly and a very courteous customer service rep listened to the details of my problem and arranged for the re-stocking fee to be returned to my card.<br />In summary I would say don't hesitate to buy this item as it seems to work very well for a lot of people, just use it enough to make sure it works and if not, return before 30 days are up and be prepared to follow up on any restocking fee.",2015-05-01

There is nothing better to help pass the time doing laps in the pool than listening to your favorite music (or podcasts, if that is your thing). I've owned several waterproof MP3 players and this one is the best because of the features and most importantly, the price.<br /><br />I have used the SWIMP3 with the bone conduction and it is okay.  If we could just get the quality of the Diver MP3 LCD with bone conduction, I would be in seventh heaven and may NEVER come out of the pool.<br /><br />The above criticism is directed right at the Diver MP3 LCD headphones.  Not sure of the issue, but if I plug any other headphones in, the volume is much higher.  Plug the standard headphones in and the volume drops by half (and yes, they are clean).  What is with the ear hooks?  If you think we need these hooks, then allow them to be removed.  Personally, they are more of an annoyance than functional.<br /><br />I love the player, but as you can tell, those headphones have got to go.  I have already ordered another waterproof pair without the hooks.<br /><br />Sound quality is more than acceptable. I transferred all of my iTunes directly to MP3 maintaining high bitrates.  I am gearing playback at usually 256 kbps and considering that I am swimming and water is flowing past my head, you can still listen to great-sounding music.  Music is easily adjusted with the onboard equalizer.  Several settings to suit just about everyone.<br /><br />I like the option of radio when I am not in the pool.  We have just one strong FM station here in the styx which works well on the pool deck, but the signal goes away when submerged in water.  This is of little concern, but it is nice to have radio available.  Would like to see AM added, just to listen to news.<br /><br />The routine I use does not need the jog meter or swim meter, so I have not utilized those functions.<br /><br />I've had a little trouble with &#34;format error&#34; stops, even on files that had worked just fine just minutes before.  I think that the processor just gets overloaded when multiple buttons are pushed.  Initially, I just plugged the device in and reformatted and reloaded overnight.  Technical support suggested that I use the option in the Diver to reformat the device or restore it back to factory settings.  You can go to Settings&#60;System Tools&#60;Format (or Restore Defaults)&#60;Yes.  Either way works fine and this is not a deal breaker …. it just interrupts the swim.<br /><br />Overall:  4 stars<br /><br />Pros: The display is very clear.<br />The Play/Pause/Volume Control buttons make the device easy to use<br />The MP3 Player keeps the charge for a long time.<br /><br />Cons: The earphones can fall off when making turns.<br />The volume maximum could be a bit higher.<br />Does not support the default ITunes format (it's easy enough to convert your songs, but it does take an extra step)",2015-07-26

Also this version has more rated amps than the model with the plugs to the top. The slot is nice to place my phone or tablet, but the one drawback (not a manufacturer issue) is putting a phone upright bends the cable which can cause cables to fray like often happens with USB cables near the connectors. I just put my phone on its side. It amazes me that manufacturers of larger surge protectors with more 120v outlets only put in 2 USB ports and often don't even bother making them 2.1a ports.

There are seven  equalizer settings ranging from rock, pop, bass boost and they all work well, depending on your tastes.<br /><br />The only video format it support is AMV. Loading other format will not work, so in order to play video on it you will need to convert your video to AMV. You can also view picture and they look decently good on the player.<br /><br />I personally wanted this for short trips or time when the iphone should just be kept in the purse. These days you cannot be too safe with those.<br /><br />It does also have a voice recorder and an FM tuner. You can even record the FM audio right onto the device. The signal was clear on the common channels in my area and the record function worked great.

If only one device is active, the switch automatically detects it and displays it. If there is more than one active device, the last one connected is displayed but switching between the attached devices can be accomplished by pressing the “Select” button on the top of the unit.<br /><br />The switch consists of a 50 cm (19.7 inches) cable attached to a triangular plug that is wider (3.25 inches) at the end which accommodates three full-sized HDMI male cables. On the top of the plug is a small selector button along with three blue LED lights numbered 1, 2, and 3. The LED of the currently active device is lit.<br /><br />I used the switch to connect two computers and a wireless screen casting device. The displays from all three look exactly the same so there is no loss of visual quality whether plugged in through the switch or connected directly to the monitor.<br /><br />In this application the switch is powered from the connected devices, so no adapter or batteries are necessary. Since I leave all three devices on, the only way for me to switch is by using the button. But, if I turn-off a device it automatically moves to one of the other connected units that is active.<br /><br />This switch solved a problem. My monitor has only one HDMI port which is always in use by an essential device. So, to use the monitor with other devices I no longer need to disconnect between them and then reverse the process when done. Now, it is all accomplished with just the press if a button. The unit works flawlessly, is unobtrusive, and saves time.",2015-04-17

This speaker is considerably larger/heavier  than many that sell here in excess of $100.  And it sounds it too.  While the sound quality doesn't reach the league of 'serious reproducers' (north of $300) , it's great at this price. If Amazon included the WEIGHT of various Bluetooth speakers in their listings it might help people calibrate their expectations about the quantity of sound and perhaps lower range capability they could expect.  The laws of physics really constrain what you can expect from a product of e.g. 50 cubic inches.  The diminutive size of many of these BT speakers doesn't really do them any favors.  My 'other' BT spkr is a Soundlink.  By comparison I'd say the Bose product is superior for portability and low-level listening.  But given the choice for a typical home scenario I prefer the Camden, it projects a much larger sonic presentation into the room.

I actually gave that model to a friend to have and decided to buy a second cleaner for myself, right? Sadly, the model I received today is entirely different from the original model.<br />The tape would not operate either hence the low score.<br /><br />There's no instructions needed to operate these - Put cleaner in, press play, tape plays for 15-20 seconds, rewinds then ejects. Easy, eh?<br />With the newer model, the tape would not even play. The VCR shut off almost immediately after pressing play. I made 2 attempts which had the same results.I started carefully looking at the actual cassette and I think the problem may be with the top/hinged flap but I also noticed the plastic tape had not moved given me the impression maybe there was some slight damage inside the actual case. The company I ordered this fromMegaRetailStore replied back to my complaint almost instantly and resolved the issue by giving me a return for free - i didn't have to return the ineffective product or anything.",2015-03-11

The speakers just stopped performing, the sound was small and muffled and no matter how many times I unscrewed and re-screwed they stopped working. Also ! the small nut, screw in the back of one of the speakers fell inward and when trying to screw it back in it would not fit back properly. Luckily Amazon Customer Service is just as amazing as many other Amazon capabilities they refunded my money immediately after I called and complained. So in short unfortunately I did not last a month with these speakers, be careful with purchasing. I'm going for Sony next",2015-01-31

After an hour or two of listening, I was perplexed as to why these high end earbuds seemed, at least to me, to have such poor midtone performance, so I popped in some of my old Apple earbuds. In comparison the Apple earbuds have more pronounced vocal performance but they did help me appreciate the more broad quality of the Beyers. The Apple buds lack clarity overall compared to these despite being able to hear vocals better. All this said, I believe that my old Klipsh earbuds sounded better overall. I'm disappointed with the volume and midtone performance on these Beyers.",2015-05-21

I recently purchased a brand new washer and dryer and they're light years ahead of where my old machines were with regards to technology. I didn't feel comfortable just plugging the new machines into the wall outlet. Since they both have elaborate electronic controls, plugging them into the wall would've had be worrying constantly about power surges, lightning strikes, etc. After a lot of online research, this Tripp Lite unit seemed to be the way to go. I'm happy to say I like everything about it, too. I mounted it on the wall behind my washer and dryer, which was easy thanks to the two mounting holes on the back of the power strip. Having seven outlets is great. I have my washer and dryer plugged into the two side outlets, which leaves five more outlets down the middle. I love that it has an on/off switch, too. This is the perfect power strip/surge protector for my needs, and the price was more than reasonable. I am completely satisfied!",2015-07-25

It is not rated for submersion, which is IP 67 or greater. So this would be fine stuck to a wall in a shower, but it's not designed to survive a fall into the bathtub<br /><br />► Mounting - Like many of its competitors, the suction cup it uses is somewhat weak and the speaker falls after a few hours when stuck to the tile wall in my bath. The speaker comes with a mini carabiner that you can use to clip it onto something, but mine was broken (no spring in the closure system) which I'm taking a half point away for. You could still use some sort of cord to hang the speaker if you have the need<br /><br />► Battery - I'm averaging between about 5 to 5.5 hours per charge with the volume up at about 75%.<br /><br />► Charging - The manufacturer chose the now ubiquitous USB Micro-B standard, which I prefer because I can use any of the hundred or so such cords I have lying around.<br /><br />► Sound - The sound is fairly good (for a water resistant Bluetooth speaker) in my opinion. I mean it's not perfect by any means, but it's more than loud enough and reasonably clear for this type of speaker<br /><br />► Bluetooth - Pairing was easily accomplished (the speaker shows up as \\""C6\\"" in my Bluetooth registry) and I was able to walk to the other end of my house without losing the connection<br /><br />► Call Quality - While I can't imagine taking a call in the shower, this does offer a speaker phone feature which I found to be marginal, but understandably so, given the water resistant properties of the speaker<br /><br />► Controls - All the more common controls are on the edge of the speaker: power, call answer, track forward and reverse, pause / play<br /><br />In conclusion, the speaker is somewhere in the range of \\""very good\\"" in its class and I'd give it 4.5 stars if it were possible.

No need to guess which most closely resembled the drawing.<br />- The 4 large bolts mounted into two 2x4's made for a secure, stable and sturdy platform.<br />- Adjusting the TV left, right, forward or back is very easy.  No bolts to loosen.<br />- Tilt is controllable and there is no sag.<br /><br />Only 2 complaints about the bracket:<br />1. Once the TV is hung on the bracket it is somewhat loose.  This is because it literally just hangs on a crossbar.  There are two small bolts to help keep it from sliding off the rails, and yes, it would be difficult to dislodge it, but it is not a tight fit.<br />2. Adjusting the tilt requires loosening 2 different locks on opposite sides of the TV.  I don't adjust tilt very often so it doesn't bother me, but it could others.<br /><br />All in all, very happy with this bracket.  Will purchase again when we get a new TV for the bedroom.",2015-05-19

However, I am pretty disappointed, as I picked up this specific model because of the component connections in the hopes of connecting some older game systems.  After failing to get it working, I checked Yamaha's own installation app, and it verified that component video + analogue audio is not supported.  So in order to get the old Xbox working, I'm now on the line for a separate component to HDMI converter.  I'm not even sure what those component jacks are there for, as I couldn't even get a picture to come through.  If you're thinking about hooking up an older XBox or Wii, look elsewhere.",2015-05-05

It's powered through HDMI, and only needs external power when using the remote. The remote, however, is usually unnecessary, since it automatically switches to an input when it receives a signal from it, and defaults to the highest-numbered input with a signal when it loses signal from another input. My cable STB is always outputting a video signal, even when off, so I put that on the highest input, then put everything else below it, so it defaults to cable and automatically switches to my Xbox, PS3, and PC as soon s they turn on, with no intervention necessary. It's so convenient, I actually bought one for my mother (despte her TV having four HDMI ports) when she asked me to set up her DVD players. She has two 400-disc 1080p-scaling DVD players, and with this HDMI switch, they and her Blu-ray player automatically switch between themselves, so she never has to remember which input each is on, and only has to turn on the one she wants to use.

I fooled around with some crimp-on insulated spade lugs that I had, but there didn't fit well. I tried bare wire but this seemed to constantly loosen itself. Finally I resorted to these Monster connectors. Literally minutes after opening the package I had a strong clean-looking connection. The spring-loaded banana ends snapped into the speaker terminal with an engaging confidence.<br /><br />While not inexpensive, they are re-usable.

This speaker is small but powerful, I'm really impressed with it. I was deciding between the BRV-X and the UE Boom, I went with this one mainly because of two factors: rugged and price, and I don't regret! I had tried the UE Boom in a local store and I thought it sounded good, but the BRV-X sounds louder and handles bass better. It is a lot bigger and heavier than the UE but it's ok, it doesn't weight much and carrying it with the straps is comfortable.<br /><br />It doesn't feel cheap at all and it will be with us on every trip we take from now on.<br /><br />The smell other reviewers talk about is just the new plastic and rubber smell that appliances akways have when new. True that it is kind of stronger on this item but I'm sure it will fade away. Also you're not supposed to be that close to it that you may smell it.<br /><br />If you want something smaller go with the BRV-1.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />UPDATE: I tried the speaker today outdoors while having a BBQ with some friends. This thing is really loud, at highest volume you had to speak up so others could hear you. Not the best sound quality if you're comparing it side to side with a higher end but for a beach or country day it is really great and almost sure it sounds a lot better than a stock car stereo that you probably hear every day and sing along.<br /><br />It was a rainy day and the speaker worked really well, I'm really loving my BRV-X.<br /><br />The NCF function is great for Android users. My friends with iPhones had a little more work to do for pairing with it. But everyone who has seen and heard this speaker has liked ot pretty much.",2015-04-02

PACKAGING.  EVAR.<br /><br />I just cancelled my return on this item.  I thought they had shipped me the wrong item because:<br />1) The converter box itself is shipped inside an opaque sleeve<br />2) The instructions, packed inside the clear baggie that everything comes in, said &#34;VGA To Video&#34;.<br /><br />So I initiated a return.<br /><br />Then I was looking to see what other sellers had a reliable composite-to-VGA adapter, and found several other instances of &#34;wrong conversion direction&#34; and &#34;wrong instructions&#34;.  So I figured, what the hell, I may as well open it up.  And I did, and the item inside was indeed the thing that was advertised.  *AND* it turns out that the instructions are for both composite-to-VGA and VGA-to-composite boxes, and which way they're folded determines which one shows.  Maybe everyone who buys one of these in its country of origin knows better than to trust what the manual cover says it is.<br /><br />So if you buy one and the manual says you have the wrong one, unpack it anyway.  You may be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />As for how it works: the colors are all wrong (they cycle--the color clock isn't synced to the picture), but also the resolution shows up as &#34;not detected&#34; so perhaps if I try it with a really-multisync monitor, instead of something that's trying hard but not really getting it right, then it might work.

I have had a lot of AVRs in the last year and a half(SR7005, SR7008, SR7009, RX-A 3010 & RX-A 3040) and this is by far the best sounding piece on the market IMO!!  I have had as many Marantz AVRs as Yamaha and I own a Marantz UD5007, so I am not a fan boy just someone who has tried enough AVRs to realized what is each offer.  I went directly from the Marantz SR7008 to the 3050 and all I can say is the difference was not that subtle.  The transparency was a pretty big step-up over the 7008 using XT32 without adding any harshness.  I am very impressed with YPAO and I went with the SR7008 specifically because I was a fan of Audyssey.  I am running a Parasound Integrated for the front Left and right and a Parasound 275 v2 bridged for the center and all I can is when running a full 7.1.4 setup with two subs it sounds amazing!!  The center can be a little harsh without an external amp because it is powering a lot of speakers (9), but once you take the front three speakers off of the receiver it is absolutely amazing and I am coming from separates in the last year including an AV7701, AV8801 and a Classe Sigma SSP.  This receiver is that good that I don't miss my old separates and it adds Atmos & DTS:X (hopefully soon)!!  Demo all the AVRs on the market to make sure you get what you want, but I don't think you can do better than this Yamaha!!",2015-08-21

I've spent a ridiculous amounts of money on an FM antennae that's in my attic and a powered AM antennae that looks like it belongs on the radar array of a sea going destroyer.  Then I discovered streaming music on the internet: streaming jazz/fusion, to be specific.  Since then, I've been looking for a way to play streaming music from the 'net through my system that didn't require a cable running from my laptop to my Yamaha RX-V667 or broadcasting a short range FM stereo signal (don't ask) from the laptop to the FM receiver.  I wanted something that looked like a piece of audio equipment; not a tabletop radio, so I ordered this Grace unit the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend and it arrived the Tuesday after the holiday via UPS.  Because I didn't want any surprises when the unit arrived, I had already downloaded the instructions for the GDI-IRDT200 from the Grace website and went about setting up an account at http://grace.reciva.com/ and selected all the stations and music streams that I wanted loaded into the receiver.  Hook up/set up was easy, because I had already reviewed the instructions several times. I used the RCA outputs and skipped the Wi-Fi in favor of a LAN cable. As soon as I had my radio registration number, I entered it into my profile at  http://grace.reciva.com/. My previously selected stations and music streams downloaded themselves into the GDI-IRDT200 after rebooting the unit by powering the unit off and on via a handy rocker switch located on the back  of the GDI-IRDT200. In no time at all I was listening to Return To Forever in 7 channel stereo.  The Good: Great sound quality via my Yamaha and Klipsch speakers. The free iPhone app is easier to use than the included remote. You can enter your Pandora info on the reciva web site.  I especially like the rocker switch on the back to power down the unit for re-booting the content of the GDI-IRDT200.  The so-so: As other reviewers have already said, the display is kinda' cheesy, although is a color match to the display my Brennan JB-7. The display works well enough but I keep expecting  Pacman to scroll across it. The method for entering Sirius info is a little tiresome, but okay once you get the hang of it.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Grace GDI-IRDT200 and would recommend it.",2015-05-27

That's been the case with this.    My needs were somewhat specific -- I switch from a set of powered speakers to headphones on my mac from time to time, and like other reviewers, don't like reaching around behind the computer every time I need to switch.  Snap crackle pop.  In addition, I listen to music a lot, and am frequently dialing the volume up or down.    The Syba met my needs perfectly.  The design, with the dial on top makes it handy to adjust (I have it on my keyboard tray).  I run the speakers out of the 1/4-inch jack so that when I plug the headphones into the 1/8-inch jack, the output to the speakers is muted.    I haven't noticed a great deal of difference in sound from the built-in sound card, but I haven't taken the time to do any kind of real comparison -- improving the sound wasn't a priority for me.

The speaker is compact and attractive and the Bluetooth interface works flawlessly, but anyone accustomed to a decent hi-fi system is going to be seriously disappointed from the outset.  I suppose it's fine for what it is, but given all the online accolades, I expected much better sound quality.  I was disappointed from the first track and repeated listenings in various settings (and with various types of music) did nothing to change my opinion.  To my ears the speaker sounds boxy and muddled and comes nowhere near approximating the audio quality of a conventional stereo system.  I would go so far as to say the sound doesn't even rival that of my Logitech 2.1 computer speakers that cost half as much.  Admittedly, I don't have much experience with Bluetooth systems and I'm comparing it to well-powered, wired speakers, but if the B2 is anywhere near the pinnacle of systems of its type (and it's certainly rated that way), then I'd stay away from Bluetooth speaker systems for the time being.",2015-07-18

I took the housing apart and found that not only was the plastic carriage assembly (which was attached to the activating button which projected through the housing) was broken, but that the button that it made contact with which was on a circuit board, that the circuit board support leg was broken off.  So I jury-rigged another support for the circuit board and hot glued the external button assembly back together and it works.  The seller/shipper had to know that the button was broken...it didn't just happen when we got it because the missing support leg for the circuit board was no where to be found inside the housing.

Includes Hard Travel Case.,Electronics,3,0,0,N,Y,"Very good value for money, with minor issues","Update: I contacted photive and let them know about the echo other people hear with the headphone microphones. They said it must be a bad unit and immediately sent me a new one.<br /><br />The new one arrived quick however , I'm getting the same issue and the battery lid is loose and has fallen a couple of times. Time to call them again. I really want to love these. The sound is great and so convenient.<br /><br />Original review: The Photive headphones are really quiet decent given the price. The sound quality is very admirable given the price point. I got these as a frequent traveller I hate wired headphones and want to drown out the noise of airports and planes.<br /><br />Build Quality - the build quality is excellent all around. A week in use (almost every day) and carrying to and from work. I like the cary case, although a little bulky in my bag.<br /><br />Sound Quality - Sound quality is very balanced. Bass is just right (now too much Base - I listen to a lot of Jazz so i don't like a heavy base). Treble is well managed and not too Tiny. All in All for the price range this is very acceptable and provides a full balanced range.<br /><br />Comfort<br /><br />- this is the one reason I ranked it one star less. Its strange but the headphones are slightly angled. This would be fine, because of the way most peoples heads are shaped that way towards the front. The only issue is that if you wear them  as they are marked (with left on left and right on right) its angled the wrong way. I just dont get it. To get a comfortable fit you have to wear them the opposite way. Now this wouldn't matter for the most part, except that puts the microphone now behind you instead infront to pickup voice. ????<br /><br />- the other issue I get is when I am listening to it for a while my ears get warm because its poorly ventilated. This isnt a huge issue as I dont wear them for more than an hour at a time but nevertheless worth noting.<br /><br />- Battery life - the battery life so far has been very impressive.

It's exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />My complaints are:<br />1. When I load a CD into the tray it spends a very very long time determining whether the CD is a DVD or not and then cueing it up for play. It takes over 30 seconds (!) before music is heard. And that is with many different CDs, not it's not a scratch or something that is causing this.<br />2.. More importantly, after a year of owning this thing, the CD player part of it became very unreliable and now fails to play a disc about 50% of the time. disappointing build quality.<br /><br />Fortunately, at this point, my CD listening is only about 20% of my total time listening to music, so i can live without it, and I can understand why they evidently didn't invest a lot of effort into making sure that part of it worked, but it is disappointing when something breaks so soon.",2015-01-02

Purchased this item in an attempt to upgrade the sound quality and battery life our 4 year old Logitech Bluetooth boombox. At first, I thought the unit sounded decent and then completed the recommended break-in period.  Tried positioning the speaker for optimal sound (corner of room), and was never blown away as some reviewers have noted.<br /><br />After a side-by-side comparison with the Logitech Boombox with the same songs (different genres of music, live versions of songs, etc), it was a very easy decision to pack up the Riva Turbo and return. Still can't believe how much better the Logitech sounded in comparison.  The Logitech has much fuller sound, better bass, and the vocals don't sound like they are trapped in a tunnel or box, like they do with the Riva.  I can live with the much shorter battery life for now, as we primarily use the Logitech for listening in the kitchen.  For the price of the Riva Turbo, I expected to be instantly impressed.  I'm more impressed that the Logitech unit delivers much better sound quality for $200 less.<br /><br />Here is the Logitech unit we will continue to use until a worthy, upgraded Bluetooth speaker unit is found.<br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005KQ2O26/ref=cm_sw_su_dp<br />We paid around $150 in 2011.",2015-06-21

47868357,R3P3ICJRUKGEIH,B00WK47UZC,179157189,Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Pearl),Electronics,5,5,9,Y,N,Amazing sound from a compact speaker,"I have tried several other Bluetooth speakers and the Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II offers the best sound of the compact speakers that I have heard.<br /><br />Sound<br />For such a small size, the SoundLink Mini II produces an impressive amount of quality sound.  The SoundLink Mini II offers the best sound of the mini speakers I have tried.  The speaker produces a surprising amount of bass for such a small size.  The mids and highs are clear and engaging without any of the distortion that I have heard from other small speakers.  From jazz to classical to rock to ambient music, the SoundLink Mini II confidently delivers solid sound.<br /><br />Directionality<br />I did find that the highs are much brighter and much more audible when the speaker is directed at the listener as compared to when the speaker is facing at an angle to the listener.  For example, the horn components of some of the jazz music I listen to sound muted if the speaker is turned away from me, but sound great if the speaker is pointed directly at me.  However, the directionality is found in most speakers (big or small) and the the Bose SoundLink Mini II is not nearly as directional as some other small speakers.<br /><br />Form and Function<br />The speaker itself is surprisingly small.  It could easily fit in a backpack or even in a jacket pocket.  It is also surprisingly heavy compared to other Bluetooth speakers which are larger than the Bose.  The weight and the solid feel of the aluminum body give the impression of quality.<br /><br />The SoundLink Mini II has a 3 mm thick rubber pad at its base which helps to keep in place on uneven surfaces.  The rubber also helps to isolate the speakers from the surface on which it is placed because the speaker does vibrate a bit due to the sound it is producing.<br /><br />The rubberized control buttons are on the top of the speaker.  The is a power on/off switch, volume controls and a Bluetooth button which you press to pair a device.<br /><br/>There is also a button which has three dots on it which is the multifunction control.  Pressing and holding this button while my Android phone was connected started a dialogue visually on my phone and audibly through the speaker to call one of my contacts.  I could tell the phone via the speaker who to call and make the call using the speaker.<br /><br />Connectivity<br />I was able to pair the SoundLink Mini II to my phone, computer and iPod easily.  You can connect to two devices at once.  There is also a micro-USB port and a 3.5 mm input to connect devices which dont have Bluetooth.<br /><br />Charging<br />According to the product manual, a full charge takes about four hours to achieve.  The SoundLink Mini II comes with a cradle which you can use to charge the speaker.  Alternatively, you can just plug the charging cable directly into the speaker (it is a micro-USB cable).  As both methods appear to work, I am not sure of the purpose of the separate charging cradle other than the convenience of just being able to place the speaker into the cradle instead of needing to plug in the cable.<br /><br />Documentation<br />There is very little in terms of documentation that comes with the speaker.  This is a setup guide that helps to get the speaker setup and connected.  To find out more information about the functionality of the speaker, you can download the product manual from the Bose website.  The address is given with the documentation included with the speaker.<br /><br />Overall<br />The SoundLink Mini II offers amazing sound from a solid feeling, small package.  While it is more expensive than some of the other Bluetooth speakers which are available, the SoundLink Mini II delivers the best sound of the ones that I have tried.  Certainly recommended.",2015-06-07

So, I bought these Senteys because they had a longer cord and hoped that they might be a little more durable. These didn't fit nearly as well.

The cable is fairly thick but doesn't get in your way, which is great. The cable that connects to the actual headset could take being ran over and yanked a little by a chair, and I would put money on it being okay afterwards. Also the microphone doesn't sag down over time, very nice!<br /><br />-Microphone sound quality and close to no background noise what so ever.<br />I use skype a lot and when i'm in group calls and someone leaves, then it's just me and one other person on the call, they asked if the call dropped but it's just because the background noise was close to non-existent.<br /><br />-Long lasting cushions<br />My previous headphones were the Bose comfort brand and I switched to these because obviously that product is designed for different use other than for skype. However, I noticed with the Bose headphones the cushions started to fall apart a bit around the same amount of time that I've had the Sennheiser's. I can see these headphones lasting 5 years or even longer if taken care of.<br /><br />-Microphone mute and volume control<br />Last but definitely not least, these headphones have the best microphone mute/volume control i've ever used. The microphone mute is controlled by the microphone literally retracting back along the side of the headphones, it's very convenient and easy to spare people on skype right before i sneeze. Kinda silly but it does become easy enough to mute before sneezing i've found. The volume control on the right side of the headphones is really just a convenience but i would consider it much easier to use instead of having a giant volume control at some point on the cord (which is never fun to use in my opinion).<br /><br />Cons: None of the cons have made me dislike the headset, but there are still cons none the less.<br /><br />-Volume range is alright.<br />This is probably the biggest of the &#34;insignificant&#34; cons. The range isn't the greatest compared to other headphones i've used. The reason I don't find this a problem is when I use headphones, I normally don't have a large range of volume. This doesn't mean you wont notice it get louder or isn't capable of being loud or quiet. My recommendation is to set your volume knob to about 40 percent to 50, then go into your sound options and try to find &#34;medium&#34; volume for your taste and consider it volume calibration.<br /><br />-Slightly large mic<br />This is pretty self explanatory, and again, it's not too big a deal because you get used to it quick. I'm just glad the mic has not sagged down.<br /><br />-Felt tight on head initially<br />This is at the bottom of all the slight quirks because this problem goes away really quick (after the first day for me). But when I first put them on it felt like the headphones were clenching my head, but the cushion pads just needed to be broken in.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: One thing I didn't add was the price because you truly pay for the quality and sturdier longer lasting product. These Sennheiser's have proven to be pretty tough thus far.<br /><br />One of the biggest things i didn't mention is how comfortable they are to wear for 5 hours to even 8 hours at a time. Open ear in my opinion is the way to go for that marathon like gaming or music listening because your ears are able to breathe. With closed ear headphones, you have a chance of having your ears sweat over a long period of time.<br /><br />I honestly would recommend these headphones for anyone that wants a long lasting pair with the quality of a more expensive pair of headphones from Sennheiser.",2015-02-07

I would venture to say that there is nothing like this out there- a non-BT/2.4GHz Kleer technology, WIRELESS, PORTABLE, headphones with a reputable manufacturer's quality backing, GREAT SOUND, for a reasonable price. Nothing. Most portable ones these days are either compressible/ laggging BT (bluetooth) or using the older IR standards. And the ones using non-BT tech, Kleer like, are usually tethered to a huge stand/holdertrnasmitter for recharging- hardly portable in the least. TDK marries the 2 functionalities uniquely. I've owned their previous model the THWR700 model and was generally pleased with it, hence I was stoked when they released this upgrade. I'll compare the 2 together later. The only other maker I know that marries Kleer 2.4GHz uncompressed technology with the portability of mobile headphones, is AKG, but they were almost twice the price and have since been discontinued. A shame that other manufacturers have abandoned this wireless format for the popular compressed BT ones.<br /><br />THWR800 vs THWR700:<br />(1) Form factor: I'd have to say the older WR700 was sleeker and more portable. It could swivel the ear pieces so that the whole HP could be compacted into a nice cloth pouch for travel. The Transmitter unit was also more compact in the older unit. The latest WR 800 has somewhat larger ear cups, and the footprint of the transmitter unit is somewhat larger by a factor of 2x, but still portable enough. The latest one did not come with a carry pouch.<br />WINNER: THWR700.<br />(2) Build quality: The WR800 wins easily. That TDK have learned from their mistakes with the WR700 is commendable. The WR700 had paint/surface treatment peeling issues (read: cosmetic) for the the hard plastic bits, which were also easily scratched.This does not seem to be a problem with the newer WR800- the finishing is better and there fewer surfaces that looked like they can be scratched. The extendable earphone arms are also more solid in the newer version- less flimy. One of the extensible arms in my WR700 &#34;broke&#34; after about 2-3 years of fairly gently use. Although I've not owned the newer ones for that long, the arm design and engineering does feel more reassuring and robust when you play around with the extensable arms. The ear cups are also made of softer and more comfortable material. The WR700 had some peeling issues around the periphery of the cups after a couple of years of usage.<br />WINNER: THWR800.<br />(3) Comfort: The WR700 ear cup size was more of an on-ear design. The newer WR800 has a larger over-ear design (not for large ears though). That and the better cushioning material used, means that the WR800 wins hands down when it comes to comfort- much less ear aching after extended use as compared to the WR700. The WR800 is very comfortable over long hours.<br />(4) Sound quality: The WR800 sounds better than the WR700, not that the 700 was bad, but the range and clarity of the WR800 sounds better. Larger magnets? Better components? I also own more expensive german designed WIRED headphones, and the WR800 holds up commendably. I am very pleased with the sound quality- they have definitely upgraded the components over the WR700's. The sound quality gives even the wired headphones a good run for the money.<br />WINNER: THWR800<br />(5) Power resource: Both used 2 sets of AAA batteries. This is both a blessing and point of contention. The advocates like the portability and ease of use. The detractors would say that it's too troublesome to change them. The phones are rated for at least 30 hours of  continuous use with a fresh set of batteries, and in my real world experience, I would agree that it came close and on occassions, exceeded it. So yes, you would have to chew through batteries every 2-3 days of heavy usage, but you need to sacrifice something for portability. Besides, the availability of disposable/rechargeable batteries these days, makes them so accessible no matter where you are. I've taken the WR700 extensively while travelling and I must say, I find myself giving thanks for the fact that they are battery operated and not something that requires external charging. I'm hoping that the newer components in the WR800 would give the power efficiency a boost.<br />(6) Reliability: Despite the numerous complaints I've read from other reviewers of the WR700, I've had mine for almost 3 years, and they are working very well. So all I can say, is that I'm pleased with reliability. The fact that I've gone on to buy the WR800 says alot.<br />(7) Misc issues: The fact that the energy saving timer cuts the power off after 5 min of idling can be a blessing and a curse. Good for when you fall asleep while listening, and bad when you get distracted- which means you have to reach for the transmitter button to reactivate it. Can't have it all. I still value the whole package more to really say that this is a deal breaker.<br />The ones sold on Amazon are blue in color. TDK has released silver and gold colored ones in Asia, but they don't seem to be readily available yet.<br />The battery compartment opening on the headphone side is a little tricky to open, but the instructions are clear enough and after the first successful attempt, it's actually quite easy to operate. It does require you to be gentle or you get a feeling something bad will happer to the ear piece. Minor issue- not insurmountable.<br />The fact that you can pair up to 6 other headphones to the same transmitter is WOW-able and adds icing to the cake. My next task is to see if they will pair up with the WR700. Now that would be sweet.<br /><br />(8) Conclusion/Recommendation: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you are in the market for an excellent sounding, portable/travel-worthy, comfortable set of heaphones. If you are mainly using this for TV/static purposes and don't require the portability, then the excellent Seinheisser RS series (800, 700) would be a more convenient option as it has its own lithium power that does not require changing of batteries.en the WR700 extensively while travelling and I must say, I find myself giving thanks for the fact that they are battery operated and not something that requires external charging.

From a Field Tech,"For the record, I am a cable tech and deal with splitters on a regular basis.<br /><br />I will say this is perfect for Antenna TV signals.<br /><br />However, I would strongly advise against this for your internet. A lot of consumers unfortunately are duped by the fact that gold and high number equals better. This is NOT the case.<br /><br />If you open this splitter up, you will see a very basic analog splitting system. This causes signal to noise ratio on the digital carrier to be lowered. I verified this by opening the splitter up. I also connected by my spectrum scanner to this splitter and picked up -30 decibels of noise. A splitter should NOT have any noise leak in! If it does, it is a result of poor shielding and connectors.<br /><br />I highly recommend Antronix splitters or equivalent. If you open a back of a high quality splitter, you should see a circuit board.<br /><br />Also, you want a 5 - 1002 mhz splitter. The max all cable plants in the US currently operate till is 1 Ghz. By getting a 1 Ghz splitter instead, you are focussing on a more distinct frequency span that your equipment actually operates at.<br /><br />Once again, this is a good splitter for Antenna TV signals. But for digital TV and DOCSIS, it is highly not recommended.",2015-01-31

Our Ultimate One seemed to work fine at first, and we were pleased.  But over time, we've become less and less satisfied.  Something changed over time, and now EVERY time we start an Activity, we need to go to the &#34;Fix it myself&#34; function because there is always one problem or another with one of the devices.  Also, the response time of the devices is MUCH slower with the Harmony than when using the the remote that comes with the device.  So, for example, when you press the Play/Pause button during a Fast Forward, it takes about 3 seconds to respond, which forces you to have to Rewind, which is then also delayed when you try to stop it.  Usually, we just end up giving up.  There is also a problem with the over-sensitive recognition of gestures, which causes things to happen when we don't want them to, and therefore must be undone.  It has become a frustration to use the Harmony remote, and we frequently end up just using the remotes that came with the devices.  Sort of defeats the purpose, don't you think? Especially when you consider the cost of this product.  We tried to re-sync the Harmony Remote to see if that would correct some of the issues we're having.  At first the sync ran for hours without completing.  The message on the remote said not to disconnect because it was in the middle of an update, but we finally disconnected/reconnected the remote, and the sync finally finished.  But, much to our disappointment, all of the problems are still there.  The only thing we can think of doing now is to delete all of our devices and activities and re-enter them.  Since this is  time-consuming, and should be unnecessary, it only adds to the frustration.  This is not the kind of PR Logitech should want for its product.",2015-04-04

When charging my Samsung Galaxy S5, each port will only put out 1.05A max. While this is still perfectly fine and still gives a decent charge rate, it is not as fast as using the 2.0A wall charger that came with my phone. However, since this is for using on a nightstand while sleeping, I don't really care that it takes a little longer. Since it charges slower, it also does not heat up the battery as much.

Poorly designed for a clock radio.,"UPDATE: I've had this radio for a while and it really is annoying how difficult it is to operate. Of course I read the manual and &#34;learned&#34; how to set the alarm, BUT there is nothing easy or intuitive about that whole process. And turning off the alarm is also NOT a simple thing to do. One of the big problems is that the entire row of operating buttons across the top - and there are NINE OF THEM - are identical in size and shape. Well, when you wake up still half-asleep in the morning and want to change something on the radio you can easily hit the wrong button, or not hold a button long enough to get the change you want.   For a long time I had a Sharper Image clock radio/CD with many different features, and at first that too was a little complicated for me to figure out how to operate, but once I understood it, it became easy because there was a kind of logic to each step. When it &#34;died&#34; I would have been happy to replace it with a new one, but it was discontinued.  For this Sangean, on the other hand, there are no simple distinctions between various functions you have to set. I know Sangean products are dependable, and have excellent sound quality for radio reception, and after having looked at reviews of other clock radios on Amazon I really didn't see a decent alternative. So I'm sticking with the Sangean, but hoping they hire some engineers who can produce a much more user-friendly and intelligently designed clock radio!  (Here is my original review, after having the radio a very short time: Very good radio, compact, but not the most-user friendly. It takes some time to figure out all the settings. I'm a fan of Sangean radios. Excellent sound quality.",2015-02-21

I've charged about 50 batteries so far, and I find this charger to work well and I consider it a good value.  It does have minor, but noteable weaknesses.<br /><br /> The i4 detects the type of rechargeable automatically, and charges appropriately.  When charging 2 batteries the charging rate is 750 ma, and 375 ma when charging 4 batteries.  AAA batteries typically take 1-2 hours to charge, and AAA take 3-6 hours.  The charger has 3-bar LED's above each slot to give an indication of charging status.  The charger stops charging when the battery is at capacity.  Each of the charging slots acts independently (ie, I just charged 3 AAA and 1 AA at the same time),  but there are some limitations with AAA batteries.<br /><br />Nitecore recommends that you do not charge a single AAA battery alone, and if you do charge 2 AAA's at a time, its recommended that you put the batteries in slots 1 and 3, or 2 and 4, to avoid overheating the batteries.  (From the manual:  &#34;Nitecore strongly recommends that AA, AAAA and 10440 Li-ion batteries are not charged alone in the i4 charger. When using only one charging slot, the i4's current automatically sets to 750mA, which exceeds the maximum current range of most AAA, AAAA and 10440 Li-ion batteries. .... it is recommended that a minimum of two (2) AAA or 10440 rechargeable batteries are placed into the charging slots together. When charging two batteries in the i4, be sure to always place them in either slot 1 and 3 or slot 2 and 4&#34;<br /><br />  The four charging slots are fairly wide, but not really large enough to fit C size batteries.  AA batteries fit into the charging slots well enough, but AAA batteries tend to slip left or right off of the terminals if bump the charger.  I don't use C rechargeables, but I would note that C size batteries barely fit well enough to reach the terminals, and you can only fit in 2 at a time.  This product listing says &#34;2X EdisonBright AA to D battery converter spacers included&#34;, but they were not included with the charger I ordered (Amazon promptly addressed this problem with my order by offering a refund)",2015-06-21

My parents seem to have difficulty managing two remotes (both of which have channel changing buttons).  They are forever using the ‘wrong’ remote for whatever they are trying to do.  This remove helped cut down the ‘tech support’ calls a little bit.<br />Because it doesn’t control a wide variety of devices, the controls are fairly limited.  This is a good thing for us, since simplifying the TV watching experience in the age of digital cable boxes and multiple inputs is our goal.  Although some functions require changing back and forth from TV mode to cable box mode, for the most part the remote can be left in the cable box setting.  That way it works the cable box channel selection, while also being able to control the TV volume.  Those are pretty much the only functions my parents want to be concerned with.<br />Great for making TV watching simple again.

Was worried that it wouldn't have enough UMPH for a rather spacey backyard, but checked some reviews and took a leap. I did not want to pay 90+ for a bluetooth speaker that would only be used at most 2 times a season. The Bose and JBL were tempting, just for their names, but to pay over 100$ for a speaker seems silly to me.<br /><br />-Pairing was easy with my Surface Pro 3, and yes it has a loud notification &#34;Pairing. Powering Off. Max Volume.&#34; etc. but it is not a continuous sound so it wasn't too annoying; just loud. Easy to live with.<br />-Volume was perfect. Outside, I could walk away about 50 feet or so, and still hear it clearly. It was loud enough that when the party started I was asked to turn it down, since people close by could not hear themselves talking. Turning it down provided a nice background soundtrack. of course, people further away could no longer hear it, but is unavoidable. The low volume is crisp and clear, while still able to give off some bass.<br />-Bluetooth has pretty good range for line-of-sight, but you will get cut-out choppiness if you carry it too far away from the source, and if there is an object between the speaker and source. However, I found that with a clear line of sight, and a full battery, I was able to carry the speaker roughly 15-20 feet away from the source.<br />-Battery is amazing. It lasted 7+ hours on one charge. It didn't die, I was done with it so I turned it off after 7 hours of constant use. Mind you, this is fresh out of the box, then charged, then used. I would guess that its estimate of 6+ hours is accurate.<br />-Deep bass, but not overpowering. Audio was still nice and clear.<br /><br />-Minus: The charging cable. Seriously... they could have just not included it. Like the other reviewer said, it is waaaay too short. The good news is that this is a mini usb jack, so any typical (non apple) smartphone plug can be used as a charger.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a budget minded and LOUD portable speaker.<br />Looking forward to taking this to the beach and camping this year.

To be fair, AVR's are more computer than anything else, so things will go wrong.That said, what has me steaming is HK customer service and technical support or lack thereof.First, they do not respond to email, second calling customer service is a futile attempt at best. Service calls are forwarded overseas and the response you get, well we all know what you get. And god bless the folks doing this job, but their responses are scripted and simply beyond worthless.And their warranty policy is outrageous. They send you an email which is basically a questionnaire that you have to complete and send back to them along with a kidney and DNA sample. And then at some point they will respond by sending you a pre-paid voucher to return your unit. No replacement while you wait options, no offer to secure one with a credit card - nope you're just out of luck waiting in limbo until they decide what they'll do for you.

52044472,R24DSIGIOC1S23,B00MJEYM5O,398004269,AmazonBasics Large Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,10,12,N,Y,Pleasing Results,"I'm not an audiophile, but I do enjoy a wide range of music, from big band to pop and rock to classical, as well as some international (Andes, China, India).  I think I have a fairly critical ear with regard to distortion and &#34;crispness&#34; in music, for whatever that's worth.  I've been using the Amazon BT-3 for several days now and am very pleased with the performance.  I like to use it in our small living room turned down fairly low for background music, and I've found that it can fill the (again fairly small) house with good-sounding music when turned up.  Both bass and treble seem appropriate to me, although I should note that I don't like extreme bass.  However, I do like crisp highs.  The Bluetooth performs flawlessly.  I have it paired with an Android phone, and Android tablet, and a Chromebox.  For any of these if I turn on the speaker and then wake up any of the devices, they connect with the speaker almost instantly.  I haven't experienced any dropouts.<br />When I first searched on Amazon for Bluetooth speakers this one caught my attention.  I considered the smaller version, but there were several reviews complaining about the Bluetooth performance.  I've had finicky Bluetooth devices before and didn't want to deal with that!  The choices in this area are almost overwhelming and honestly, I was ready to give up and order the Bose Mini when I read that the Bose Mini II was due for release, so I stepped back and thought, &#34;I really don't need nor can I appreciate a $200 speaker.&#34;  With that I went back to my original idea and ordered the Amazon Basics large speaker, and I'm happy with that decision.<br />A couple of observations -- It's not immediately obvious which is the front and which is the back of the speaker, and initially I set it down backwards right after taking it out of the box.  The next morning I was looking closely at it and realized my mistake (the Bluetooth symbol is toward the front).  The on-off switch has an unusual configuration -- ON is down and OFF is up.  Not a problem at all, just seems unconventional.  If you forget to turn it off after disconnecting your device it turns off automatically, and you just need to cycle the switch to OFF and back to ON to get it to turn on again.  Note that the charging connection is the typical coaxial type rather than micro USB.  This is an issue so some people, so just be aware.",2015-06-16
26935819,R3UAPH2V1W61Z3,B00R5G9WEC,77407403,Cayin N6 PCM1792A chip DSD lossless music player,Electronics,5,19,23,N,N,Hi-Res DAP that makes your music come alive!,"There is definitely a WOW! factor once you hold N6 box in your hands.  They made it very clear you are dealing with a premium product in a premium box.  You are not going to find any high res pictures on the outer sleeve, only a hand sketch of the product with some hints of its sexy curves.  There is also a very minimum description of main functions and features, mostly referencing types of devices and supported formats with no further description, I guess trying to keep user in suspense.  With outer sleeve off and the main box out and open, you are presented with premium &#34;jewelry&#34; box display setting of N6.  Out of the box underneath a form fitted tray with N6, you'll find all the included accessories in another partitioned tray.<br /><br />To be honest, for such a fancy box and premium flagship product, I expected to see more accessories.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s on par with other DAPs I have reviewed in the past, but would have been nice to see something like a leather holster or a travel case or maybe to include 2A wall adapter.  Still, there were plenty of goodies to go around.  You have a quality usb to micro-usb cable, coax adapter, micro-usb to usb card reader, and two sets of round screen protectors with one already being applied to N6.  One bonus that I actually found impressive was a keychain with the same carbon fiber finish as featured on the back of N6 – fancy!  Also included was a silicone protection skin, but it wasn’t in the box but rather in the packaging envelope.  I know it’s a shame to hide N6 curves under the “skin”, but it’s a smart way to protect it from scratches.<br /><br />Looking at N6 DAP, the first thing you notice is a rather unique round display - a centerpiece of the design.  Just like with their C5 portable amp that stood out from a crowd, N6 makes a very bold statement even before you turn it on and plug in your headphones.  Even though display looks round, the active part of it is 2.4&#34; IPS square screen with a high contrast and excellent visibility under any condition.  With display off, it's hard even to distinguish the square part of the screen, thus you have an illusion of a round display.  On the left side of the display like a watch crown you have a thumb control navigation wheel to assist in scrolling and also with a spring-loaded push action to click/select/enter.  I found this scrolling wheel to have an excellent tactile response and to be of a great assistance when scrolling through either a long playlist or adjusting volume or just going through menus.  It's not really necessary for navigation of N6 since all these functionalities could be done with other buttons, but still comes in very handy and blends in well with a round screen display.<br /><br />Below the display, you have 4 control buttons in a very unique shape.  When it comes to N6 DAP, it looks like Cayin wasn't just creating a functional audio player with a great sound, but also making a piece of art.  In theory, these are your typical multifunctional 4 directional buttons with up and down list scrolling or track skip or fast forward/back, and left and right buttons for going back in navigation or selection or play/pause.  It takes a little bit to get used to controls, but after a while using these becomes a second nature.  I also think a custom shape of these buttons plays a very important role in a flow of navigation and controls as your finger slides across them.<br /><br />You will also find a more traditional buttons, such as volume up/down in the upper right corner on the side, and a power button on the top.  With a screen off, volume buttons do control volume with a single click and skip track with a long press.  Also, scrolling wheel controls play/pause with a push when screen is off - a very intuitive control you can access without even looking at the player.  At the top, you also have three 3.5mm ports for Line Out (LO), Headphone Out (HO), and Coaxial cable Out (CO).  To eliminateconfusion, I did cut off HO cover flap in silicone case so I knew right away where to plug in headphones.  At the bottom you have micro SD card slot, a reset pinhole, a tiny led light pinhole, and micro-usb port.  The body of the case is made out of aircraft-grade aluminum alloy and feels very solid in your hand.  The back of N6 has a real carbon fiber finish.<br /><br />As impressive as it looks outside, inside of N6 you will find a true audio powerhouse.  Everything from dual core processor, powerful enough to support native DSD hardware decoding as well as other formats up to 24bit/192kHz resolution with MP3/WAV/FLAC/OGG/APE/ALAC/AAC/WMA/M4A and even CUE, to 8GB of internal memory and microSD card supporting up to 128GB size.  You also have a very impressive array of internal chips with top performance dual PCM1792A DACs arranged to process left and right channel separately to control high definition of a sound and a width of soundstage separation.  There is also a dedicated high performance PGA2311 volume control chip, and even 3 different TCXO crystal oscillators to meet low jitter clock requirements.  Power is provided by a high capacity 5600 mAh lithium battery which does a great job of supplying enough juice for up to 7-8 hours of continuous playback.  For a piece of audio equipment with so many power hungry ICs, this is actually not a bad performance.  Also, Cayin is constantly working on battery life optimization, especially in standby mode, so perhaps with some future firmware upgrades they might even be able to improve a total playback time.<br /><br />Another important spec worth mentioning is the HO and LO output performance where HO is rated at 220mW+220mW w/32ohm load and super low output impedance of 0.26ohm, and LO rated at 1.7V of output power.  I had no issues driving any of my IEMs or open/closed back full size headphones, and even in low gain setting had a volume at only 30%.  Even with low sensitivity headphones I never exceeded 50% of volumelevel.  With high sensitivity headphones, I didn't hear any hissing and found background to be solid black.  But in general, if you need to drive power hungry high impedance full size headphones, you can always pair up N6 with another member of Cayin family - C5 portable amp.<br /><br />Furthermore, besides being a standalone digital audio player, N6 also functions as an asynchronous USB DAC which you can connect to your laptop or computer to turn N6 into an external sound card.  One thing you need to know, the internal memory of N6 has a zip file with all the necessary drivers to setup the connection.  Once installation is complete, moving forward it’s a simple plug'n'play operation as long as you have DAC mode enabled in your System setting of N6.<br /><br />Even with so much electronics and a large battery, N6 still feels pocket friendly and not that heavy.  For a comparison, I put N6 next to X5, both wearing a silicone case, and found N6 to be 248g with 128mm x 70mm x 20mm dimensions, and X5 to be 218g with 118mm x 70mm x 16mm dimensions.  It is a little bit taller and thicker in comparison to X5, but overall weight felt the same and inside of the pocket N6 was actually a lot easier to operate &#34;blind&#34; with fast access to play/pause, skip, and volume controls.<br /><br />Before I get into a sound of Cayin N6, the next topic I would like to discuss is GUI interface.  Of course the sound characteristic is the most important factor, but a poorly designed controls and user interface can ruin your experience of enjoying the music even if it sounds great.  I already mentioned about how much I like buttons/wheel controls of N6, and the same positive experience extended to graphic user interface as well.  When you hold the power button to turn it on, you are greeted with a round vinyl-disc main interface resembling a turn table.  In there, you have 5 main menu choices of Playing Now (which goes to your current playing song), Music Library (where you have an option to update the library, to view Local memory content, and removable card content), Music Category (were everything is sorted by My Favorite, Recent Played Songs, Albums, Artists, Genre, and a list of All Songs), System Setting, and Music Setting.  Playing Now and Music Library is self explanatory, while in Music Category you have My Favorite based on a quick playlist you can create by tagging songs as Favorite, and the rest of the menu choices with songs sorted based on the ID tags of your music files.<br /><br />Music setting has an extensive selection of options with Gain setting (low and high), Digital Filter (added in fw1.1 where you have SHARP and SLOW with a subtle change of sound attack, my personal preference being SHARP), DSD gain compensation, EQ setting (10 band EQ with 8 presets and a separate Customizable option). Play mode (to cover different repeat modes), Breakpoint resume, Gapless playback (after fw1.1 it's nearly perfect!!!), Max Volume limit setting, Startup Volume, Startup volume value, Balance control (L/R), Album art (display on/off), and Lyrics (display on/off).  In a System setting you have Language selection, USB Mode (usb connection to read and to transfer files or USB DAC setting as external soundcard), Backlight time, Brightness setting, Schedule Power off (enable/disable), Schedule Power off time (this will turn off N6 after a preset time; Sleep time option is coming in the next firmware update), Reset (to factory setting), About the Player (which has model and firmware number, as well as local and microSD card total and remaining free memory capacity).  Also, within &#34;About the Player&#34;, you can skip pages from the main screen to see a very comprehensive electronic manual of the N6 with all the controls and functionality description.<br /><br />Uh, so here comes a sound, and the first word out of my mouth was: WOW!!!  To be honest, I personally don’t care about what DAC or volume IC or processor is being used in the design.It’s irrelevant because you can pick’n’choose the best available audio components and still mess up the signal flow, the circuit design, the layout of the board, etc.  I look at every DAP as a black box, evaluating it on a sound quality, control usability, and GUI.  In my opinion, Cayin N6 delivered a nearly perfect score in every single of these categories.<br /><br />Reviewing sound quality of a DAP is not an easy task.  What you hearing is not a direct “sound” of the audio player but rather a sound delivered by headphones according to their sound signature.  So a better evaluation of a DAP is by referencing it to other sources for comparison.  I have a number of DAPs in my collection, such as FiiO X1 and X5, HiFiMAN HM700, Hidizs AP100, and more budget oriented audio players from xDuoo, Sandisk, Ruizu, and also my Galaxy Note 4.  If I pick the best source out of this bunch, which happens to be X5, and even after pairing it up with either of my favorite portable amps, C5 and E12A, I still can’t get anything closer to a near perfection reference sound I get from HO of N6.  Yes, that good!!!<br /><br />N6 sound is very detailed, transparent, and musical, with an organic tonality, close to reference quality without being cold or analytical.  It has an excellent separation and layering of instruments with a wide and deep airy soundstage.  Relative to headphones in my collection, there is no hissing or background noise (though I don’t have SE846 to confirm which always comes up as being over-sensitive), and I found it to have a black background.  In comparison, the level of detail retrieval from N6 is on a much higher scale than X5, and the soundstage presentation is significantly better as well.  As a matter of fact, the soundstage directly from N6 will remind you a lot of C5 paired up with X5.  And that is a beauty of N6 where you don’t need to pair it up with any external portable amps to improve the sound quality or staging unless you want to experiment with coloring of your sound by introducing other amps.  I paired up N6 with E12A, but found it handicapping the soundstage width and depth.  Pair up of N6 with C5 is great if you really need to drive a demanding high impedance cans, but comparing N6 HO in low gain to N6+C5 (in low gain as well) – sound tonality was almost identical to my ears, and the only benefit was a slight improvement in width and depth of soundstage.<br /><br />In conclusion, next to my other audio players and amps Cayin N6 DAP is without a doubt TOTL audio equipment.  Of course a question begs to be asked how it compares to AK120 II or AK240 II, and perhaps in a near future I might be able to answer this.  But N6 is still 1/2 the price of the cheaper AK120 II, and that needs to be factored in.  Do I think N6 represents an absolute perfection?  Well, it has a sound signature which is near a sound perfection to my ears, and I got used to and enjoying its controls very much.  But based on the size and the weight, it’s not exactly super portable or a pocket friendly for everyone’s taste.  Plus, I wish battery life would be a few more hours longer.  I know Cayin is working hard on firmware optimization, and they have done an amazing job delivering a very stable FW1.0 followed by FW1.1 only a month later with a lot of improvements.  So I hope they can do some magic to squeeze even more out of their battery life.  But even as it stands, this digital audio player represents an amazing value with a true hi-def sound performance.  I never really listened to DSD audio files until I got N6 where it plays these without skipping a beat with a sound quality that took my breath away.  I no longer need an external amp to improve my soundstage presentation or to add that extra juice to make my bass sizzle with layers of texture – N6 internal DAC/amp is top class!  I no longer have to reach out for a dedicated USB DAC to enjoy listening to hi-def audio from my laptop – flexibility of N6 design covers that.  There are too many benefits to list and I can go on, but the bottom line is that Cayin delivered a remarkable hi-def audio player and set a new price bar which is quite affordable considering spending the same amount of money on mid-fi DAPs, LO cables, and external amps without even reaching 100% level of N6.  Very impressive considering this is Cayin’s very first portable DAP release!  Can’t wait to see what they’re going to come up with next!",2015-01-31

I'm surprised Noontec is not as well known as some other more common &#34;household&#34; headphone names.  So far everything I have tested from Noontec had a consistent quality, and they don't just look good but also sound great.  Rio S is not an exception, and I would like to share with you more about what I found.<br /><br />Arrived in a premium packaging, my only comment about the cover art is a picture of the guy with headphones.  Similar to Hammo S where they used a male model, I assume the Noontec wants to make a point these headphones are &#34;designed in Italy&#34;, thus have a sense of fashion.  But in my opinion, using people wearing their headphones, especially small in-ear monitors, takes away the focus from the product.  I would prefer to have just a picture of Rio S on the cover, similar to how they did with Zoro II HD.  The back of the packaging has images of all 4 available colors, and the front has a magnetic flip cover with a detailed description of the design and the functionality on the inside.<br /><br />Out of the box you will find a pair of Rio S headphones, a nice compact zippered case, and 4 pairs of hybrid silicon eartips.  It's always nice to see a hard shell case included with headphones instead of a flimsy pouch.  Regarding silicone tips, I assume it should be in 4 different sizes corresponding to L/M/S/XS, though I noticed that both of my small tips were nearly identical in size.  Either way, these are higher quality eartips and the core is colored according to the color of headphones - a perfect match.  I'm just guessing that other Rio S headphone colors probably come with matching eartips.  Also, shirt clip was included.<br /><br />Now, on to a design to check out if they stand up to &#34;fashion hi-fi&#34; label.  Starting with a headphone plug you will find a gold plated connector with a slim plastic housing and a nice strain relief.  The cable is flat, noodle style, with a slightly &#34;sticky&#34; rubbery texture.  Flat cable usually helps with cable management to keep it tangle free and easy to wrap for storage, and also helps with microphonics to reduce the noise of cable rubbing against your cloth.  Shirt clip can assist in that as well, though I rarely see anybody use a shirt clip nowadays.  Y-cable splitter is short and flat, matching the overall shape of the cable, and it doesn't have any strain relief which would have been a good idea on the common side of the cable.  On the splitter side I was surprised to find a chin-slider, not really necessary with a cable that has in-line remote because you can't slide it all the way up, but in this case a chin-slider (moved slightly up) works like a strain relief, helping to create a bigger bend radius.<br /><br />The right side of the cable has in-line remote with a single multi-function button and a mic pinhole on the opposite side.  In-line remote shape flows nicely with the rest of the design, following slim/flat/rectangular theme.  It was a good idea to include a single button universal remote which should work with majority of Android phones and iPhone (don't have iPhone to test, through).  I had no issues using it with my Galaxy S5 and Note 4, and was able to control playback with single click Play/Pause and Call, and track skipping with multi-clicks, and starting Google Now with long press.  Using built in mic during phone calls yielded excellent results with crystal clear sound quality.<br /><br />Moving up the cable closer to earpieces, you will find metal accent buckle with Rio logo.  It's just a &#34;fashion&#34; detail without adding too much distraction or extra weight, a nice touch.  Attached to earpieces, cable goes through a plastic strain relief sleeve which has L/R marking on the inner side to distinguish otherwise symmetrical earpiece design.  Personally, I'm using in-line remote side to ID the Right earpiece so there is no need to even look at the marking.  The actual shape of the shell has nice ergonomics with a nearly flush design that doesn't stick out of your ears and the inner part that comfortable fits inside of your ear canal without going too deep.  There is an air-vent pinhole at the bottom of the nozzle and a nice logo plate on the back.  I do have to mention that from a distance someone could mistake them for a new &#34;beats&#34; in-ears, but closer look clears it up - they definitely have a distinct design.  Also, I was able to wear these wire down and wire up, no difference in sound quality, but wire up made a fitment more secure especially when you use them during exercising.<br /><br />When it comes to a sound tuning, Noontec stayed on a safer side without too much of aggressive bass or too much of analytical harsh brightness.  Rio S has a very balanced smooth detailed sound signature.  Just a perfect tuning to work with any music style.  Sound is very clean, not too bright or too muddy, great for extended listening without worrying about ear fatigue.  Bass has a great quality, rather than boosted quantity.  Soundstage has an intimate feeling with an average depth and width, and it sounds good from any source without a need for an amp or EQ.<br /><br />In more details, low end has more focus on mid bass punch, but still extends down to sub-bass, though it doesn't go too deep.  Mid bass is not necessary very fast, but it's still got a nice speed, just not a very sharp attack.  There is a little bit of bleed into lower mids, but it's not too bad since mids are already smooth and warm.  Lower mids have a nice warmth that adds to organic body of the sound, upper mids are very clean and clear, and at the same time smooth without any harsh peaks.  Treble extension is excellent with a great definition and clarity without even a hint of sibilance.<br /><br />Summary.<br /><br />There are so many headphone manufacturers who focus on fashionable design with flashy colors and exotic earpiece shapes (often, not even comfortable to wear).  But when you start listening to these headphones, you quickly realize they are using generic off-the-shelf drivers that doesn't sound too good.  Sound tuning is a very important part of the design, and Noontec own Votrik driver delivers a true hi-fi performance.  It has a specific sound signature that works with any music style and a pleasure to listen to for an extended time period.  Combined with a great ergonomics of comfortable fitment, it's also a pleasure to use for an extended time period, either if you are relaxing at home or exercising at the gym.  If you get a chance, definitely check them up - for sure, they sound as good as they look!",2015-08-30

The plastic headband started to weaken and spread quite a lot only after a few weeks of light use, but again, given the cost I am not too worried if I break it - but I'm knocking a star off for it. I wouldn't buy another one pair if the band breaks because I don't have a large head and the band stretching this much shouldn't happen for an average sided noggin. The stretched band also results in a looser fit which means a reduced seal with the ear that lets in ambient noise. The ear pads are comfortable despite sitting on the ears for hours some days - maybe that's due to the spread headband. The set is pretty light. The cord is on the longish side if you just use this with your cell phone.<br /><br />The lows frequencies are almost nonexistent. There's just enough to let you know there's a drummer pounding the bass, but it's definitely nothing overpowering and not punchy or boomy - it's just barely there. The mids are recessed and slightly veiled and the highs are just meh - I don't think there's much reach on the high end. But really, this is nitpicking because these sound so much better than a $200 seat of Beats and an outstanding value at $15 which is what I paid for mine. I think these go as low as $10 on occasion. For the cost of a set of winter ear muffs, I have a decent set of headphones that play music well enough for mass transit commuting - and also keeps my ears warm ;)<br /><br />My better set is Audio Technica's ATH-A900x which are probably on low end of the high end, but those are too unwieldy to take outside imho. So comparing these two headphones, I can easily say the set of Sony's has great price to performance ratio.",2015-02-13

28964550,RVP8ZOEULBOU6,B00N32ICIE,915537237,Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker (Black),Electronics,4,2,2,N,N,Bose Soundlink Color Bluetooth Speaker in Mint Review,"This is a review of the Bose Soundlink Color Bluetooth Speaker.  I did not purchase this from Amazon, but got this as part of a rewards program.  The color selected was Mint, which was the most appealing out of the colors.  If not Mint, the second choice would have been Black as it is very neutral and probably would not show dust or dirt as much.<br /><br />Sound: The most important characteristic of speakers.  In short, I enjoy the sound of this speaker.  It is loud enough for my one bedroom apartment, though it will not be shaking any walls.  It is clear, having a decent presence of treble that is on the smooth and mellow side, which I like and find not fatiguing as other speakers that have piercing treble.  It has some depth with adequate bass, that does better than most portable speakers in the compact range.  The two that outperform this speaker in full-bodied sound with deeper base are the Bose Soundlink Mini and the JBL Charge 2.<br /><br />I do own the Bose Soundlink Mini as well, which does get a bit louder, hits deeper bass notes, produces a more rich sound, and does appear to have better stereo separation.  On some songs, the difference is not as noticeable.  However, on a lot of others, especially those with any amount of bass notes, the difference was significant for both my wife and I to notice.  Now the Soundlink Mini appears to put out as much rich sound as can possibly be created from a portable compact speaker that size.  Naturally, it will not put out subwoofer type of sub-bass that a full-sized system or home theater would.  However, just to hear the Bose Soundlink Mini gives that &#34;wow factor&#34; every time.<br /><br />The Bose Soundlink Color is no slouch though. It is still impressive, and will have most thinking that it is a good speaker, especially considering the size and most of the other options available.  It does not give me quite the &#34;wow factor&#34; of the Mini, but the sound it produces is still appreciated.  If you are in the audience that does feel the Mini produces too much bass, the Color may be just right.  If you want to get more bass effect, placing the speaker within a foot of a wall will definitely provide some boost.  One thing that the Color does better than the Mini is produce better listening angles.  What this means is that if you sit directly in front of the Mini, the treble sounds good, but once you start moving to the side, the effect is not as clear.  The Color appears to keep the treble at much larger angles.<br /><br />For those people who have gave a good listen to the Bose Soundlink Color and still think the sound is still &#34;bloated,&#34; perhaps a more appealing speaker would be something like the Denon Envaya Mini which is known for its clarity.  However, my preference is towards more bass, which appears to really lack in the vast majority of these portable compact speakers, especially at lower volumes.  I wanted something something that separates itself from that and believe that the Soundlink Color is successful in this regard, with the Soundlink Mini doing it even better.  However, I am open to larger portable bluetooth speakers and am wondering if the upcoming Aiwa Exos-9 will be able to produce the subwoofer levels of bass that I crave beyond what the Soundlink Mini can produce.<br /><br />Build: The Bose Soundlink Color is plastic all around, appears durable, and well made.  The buttons have more distinctive clicks underneath the rubberized unibody-layer on the top of the speaker.  It definitely feels a lot more portable, and is lighter, than the Soundlink Mini.  The Soundlink Mini does look very high-end with the full aluminum housing.  For some reason, I find the Soundlink Color in Mint more unique and appealing, though not as high-end as the Mini.<br /><br />Performance: Most people will find the design to be very convenient.  The pairing with bluetooth devices worked overtime with ease and consistency.  That is the main thing.  The battery has been lasting easily 8 hours of off-and-on use at moderate volumes.  In addition, people will enjoy the Micro-USB charging, the ability to pause, fast forward, and back track, all of which are more convenient than the Soundlink Mini.  One thing that is missing, but is more of a wish, is that this is not water resistant.<br /><br />Overall I rate the Bose Soundlink Color a 4.3 out of 5.0 stars.  With my preferences considered, I know there is a better speaker out there (Bose Soundlink Mini) in this portable compact bluetooth speaker category.  However, it would be in the top four speakers in this category.  Others being the JBL Charge 2 and the Denon Envaya Mini.  I also hope to listen to the Aiwa Exos-9 when it comes out, but that is barely portable and far from compact.<br /><br />UPDATE July 11, 2016:<br />The Bose Soundlink Color continues to perform well.

My livin area has a sliding glass door leading to an outside patio/pool area on one side that just about covers about 12 ft, so I have an very amble amount of ambient light that pours in during the day light hours. I previously had an Elite Screens pull down matte white screen that looked beautiful during evening hours, but was washed out quite a bit during the day, so much so it really wasn't worth using. I did some research and found out that most ambient light rejecting screens were astronomical in price and I could not justify $3500-$5000 for a screen (my projector was sub $1500) so I thought I was doomed to only evening big screen glory UNTILL, I stumbled upon Elite Screens &#34;new&#34; Cinegrey 5D screens and material. I wanted to give it a shot, but I still didn't want to pay $800-$1400 for a screen when I could easily build one for less that $200 (well less actually) so I scoured the ends of the Internet and found a company that sold the Cinegrey 5D material WITHOUT the screen. I purchased a swatch of the material large enough for anyone to build up to a 135' screen (I cut mine down to about 120'). After taking some measurements,  I went to my local Home Depot, and bought the hardware I needed to build the frame and border. I then went to a local fabric store and bought about 3 yds of black felt for the border pieces (more than enough) and I built my screen. Once it was complete, I hung it on the wall and fired up the projector. I was amazed at the difference. ambient light and all, I was viewing 120' of big screen joy in the middle of the day and it looked wonderful. Even in the evening, the Cinegrey 5D material really brings out the detail in the picture. If you have the know how and the &#34;Tim the tool man&#34; ability, I recommend you do exactly as I did and save yourself a ton of money buy building your own. If you are not comfortable to take that on, then by all means, purchase one of these screens with the Cinegrey 5D material, you will not be disappointed, it works like a champ at the fraction of the cost of competitor solutions. Take a look at my photos and see for yourself!!w how and the &#34;Tim the tool man&#34; ability, I recommend you do exactly as I did and save yourself a ton of money buy building your own.

Headphones,Electronics,2,2,2,N,Y,"Sounds good, but just digs into my skull.","After doing some research these headphones had come up a number of times with stunning reviews and I decided I would give them a try. I've had them for a while now and while yes the sound is good for a low to medium tier headphone I could not get over one simple thing: these headphones are UNCOMFORTABLE. I noticed that the band was narrow but I figured that since they were pretty light and no one else had problems I wouldn't either. Unfortunately for me, these just feel like they are digging into the top of my skull and I have a hard head. I've tried to move the band to different positions on my head, but still found no relief.<br />Additionally some places list these as over the ear headphones (like in Amazon's comparison chart), this is not the case. I don't have particularly large ears and I even had my girlfriend who has small ears try them on. For both of us these did not encompass our ears comfortably and we settled with using them like on-ear headphones. Having them on-ear isn't really comfortable though as the pads aren't as soft as on-ear pads normally are. This is a minor problem to the headband, but is an important consideration.<br />Overall, I couldn't use these for more than a couple of hours without needing an extensive break (1-2 days). I have had no other problems with my past headphones quiet like these ones give me. Other people don't seem to have a problem though as noted by the massive amount of good reviews. I would just be a little wary if you get these and maybe even prepare to buy a headband wrap for extra cushion.",2015-02-01

The good outweighs the bad and (at the price I paid) it is excellent.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />It works great at holding monitors.

Very solid.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />The packaging is just &#34;throw the parts in a box wrapped in plastic&#34;. There was damage to the finish as if it had been previously used, but I believe this is just from being in the box with no padding.<br /><br />There are decorative plastic covers over the joints. Many of these broke when I removed them. You *must* remove them to get to the adjustment bolts to tighten/loosen the joints. One was broken when I took it out of the box. I didn't force them, they're just badly designed. I left them off, leaving the whole arrangement with a slightly more industrial look, but this is not important in my application.<br /><br />Once set, it can not be adjusted without wrenches.

I also own the AudioSource S3D40, also purchased from Amazon. The S325, while allegedly having less power than the S3D40, actually meter tests as being identical. Bear in mind that both have a signal to noise ratio at 80 Db which translates to being somewhat noisy when compared to a modestly priced stereo receiver. The bonus of the S325 is that you can adjust treble and bass via a small remote control. Without the remote, you cannot make those adjustments. The base unit has a volume control, but no tone controls. A major flaw in the S325 design is that you cannot shut it off with the remote. You must have physical access to the top of the unit. You can place S325t in standby via the remote, but it will continue to draw power and flash a bright red light to indicate that it's in standby mode. If you elect to shut the unit off, it immediately defaults to the lowest volume setting and without your chosen tonal adjustments. You will have to re-designate your choice of treble and bass. The speaker cloth on the front of the unit is thin enough so that a bright red lighted graphic of your volume designation is always visible, unless you cover that area of the speaker cloth. The S325 does not have HDMI inputs, just two paired RCA inputs and one optical input. Amazon's descriptive copy says the S325 is 29.5 inches wide. Actual width is 32.5&#34; Audio quality is much better than the audio in most flat screen TVs. It doesn't compare, however, with the audio you'd receive from a modest quality amplifier and paired speakers.",2015-02-03

I think it is very well built and has a very warm full body sound signature, even comparing with my Conrad Johnson Prime 18 and Sun Audio 2A3 and VT25 tube amps.  It is extremely comfortable to ware up to four to five hours.  Treble is smooth and bass is tuneful.  The best part is the mid range. Great for strings and vocals.  It handles single instrument as well as full orchestra. I have tried it with Fiio X3ii and iBasso DX50.  Due the different sound signature of the players, a proper cable is important to fine tune the Fidelio.  With Fiio X3ii a 7N pure copper cable brought out more balanced and fuller sound.  Meanwhile a less expensive Silver plated copper OCC will do a good job to bring out the treble texture from smooth or sometimes dulling DX50.

All the buttons are on the right earbud.  The volume down control is a little awkward as you have to put your thumb on the opposite side (closest to your ear) to be able to depress it.

For $11, it was hard to really go wrong. I have the Bose AE2. The felt pads don't fit perfectly, but they work. My worry is that the adhesive will not fit well enough to last long term, but I'm pretty careful with my headphones, so they should be ok. The kit comes with a yellow, plastic lever that was super helpful when putting the new pads in. You will need to use it. I have no idea what the pink fish-like thing is for, honestly.<br /><br />My one knock on this product is the lack of instructions - there are none - not on their website either. You will need to find a video to watch on Youtube (there are plenty, just search for Bose {insert model} earpad replacement). The videos are helpful on Youtube, so rely on that for help.<br /><br />A key, when putting the new ones in is making sure you get the ring (you'll see what I'm saying) under each of the plastic tabs around the inside of the earpieces. Make sure you get them all under properly to ensure your pads stay in place. Also, I would have some q-tips and alcohol handy to clean the inside carefully (DO NOT pour alochol in them). Dab the q-tips in alcohol and then gently wipe the inside of the earpieces to get them clean.<br /><br />Overall, these will feel a bit stiffer. No doubt they are not quite as nice as your originals, but they are pretty close. Just expect them to be stiffer because they are not worn in and softened up due to your use, like your old ones. Give them some time before you judge them completely. Also, remember that you paid a bunch of money for your first set (right?!) and these are pretty affordable.<br /><br />4 stars for a good product. -1 star for no instructions and a strange additional product with no explanation.",2015-01-13

I compared them to Bose QC 15s I use for travelling, in case anyone else has those and is thinking about buying an extra pair of cheaper headphones.<br /><br />- Obviously the Bose QC 15s are more comfortable, being over-ear, and the padding is softer. While the AmazonBasics are comfy, I agree with other posters that these being on-ear, they are tight around your head, but I'm hoping they will stretch out with time.<br />- The cord is short, but if you're sitting at a desk it's an acceptable length. The Y-cord didn't bother me as much, but for tall men this may be shorter than they would like.<br />- Bass is definitely emphasized. I think they sound a little muddier than the QC15s, because it sounds like the bass/mids/treble have been maxed out on the equalizer when listening with these headphones. The sound quality is still good, just different.<br />- They feel just as sturdy as my QC15s. Build quality is very good.<br /><br />For this price, I highly recommend.",2015-01-04

I've tried many of the multi-plug in a single adapter approaches on the market without satisfaction.  Additionally, it seems the plug is always loose for one reason or another and often falls out of the receptacle.  This is, at least aggravating and at most a fire hazard.  On our last EU trip we carried three phones, three laptops and two tablets.  Keeping them charged convinced me to come up with another approach.  I've adopted the idea to pack a single US multi-receptacle power strip & simply adapting it's US plug over to match the local mains receptacle using Ceptics GP-5PK adapters.  They are just the ticket for much of the travel I've got in the near future.  With this pack we only carry the adapters needed for our trip and have plenty of US receptacles for all the devices needed.

WORTH THE $$$,"I bought this through best buy for $930 including taxes. I was actually wanting to buy its newer and bigger brother Sony shake 55 (3,000 watts rms) but I couldn't find very many reviews on it. I wish I would of got the Sony shake 55 because I love the Sony Shake 5!! Sony shake 55 was also cheaper $799 plus tax. So with this being an older model and not as much power as Sony shake 55, I have no idea why it was $100 more. There was a lot more reviews on this one than shake 55 was the reason I got this model. I absolutely love it!! I been into music and fascinated with stereo systems and installing them in my vehicles since I was 16. I'm that guy with 2 batteries in their car, did the big 3 upgrade, has 2 amps one for subs and the other for speakers and I put out a total of 1600 TRUE RMS watts just in my car. No I don't think this system is a true 2400watts but neither is Sony's competitors. This system is still AMAZING!! the volume goes up to 50. I had the volume up to 45 and the pictures hanging on the wall in the other room was moving. It is clear with no distortion even at high volumes. The Bluetooth connects flawlessly with is a huge plus for me since I listen to Pandora a lot. You can even skip the song on Pandora using the stereo remote. I love that it has different  led patterns and different colors.  You can turn them off it you don't want them on. This system is made well and the quality is very good. It is very pretty heavy, the whole unit weighs 160 pounds. I don't DJ but it has dj effects that does various things to the music and you can adjust the different levels. It has mic input and setup for 2 rca jacks which is nice.It has different eq settings like football/pop/hip-hop etc.. You can even create your own eq with high- low- mids and they each can go up to +6. It has a bass  bazuca button that gives it more bass with a push of a button but that button isn't on the remote which kind of sucks. This also has party chain mode which allows you to connect ANY other stereo that has party chain mode. It will be synced and play the same thing at the same time. So down the road you can upgrade your system and still keep your current one.  Samsung and some of the other competitors don't have the party chain mode. I wish it had more than one cd disc changer. I wish it had (2-3) 1' tweeters on each speaker box rather just one. This is an excellent home stereo system!! I don't have nothing to say negative about it other than the small stuff that I mentioned.  I would  advise getting the Sony shake 55 because its the bigger brother of this model, more power and a cheaper price. I didn't because I wasn't able to find more reviews on it and was unsure about it. But I'm satisfied with this model so I'm going to keep it!! It doesn't disappoint!!",2015-02-12

Battery life is also great: I never swim for longer then 1.5 hours and it never died on me. Full charging happens in less then an hour.<br />Sound quality is around average: bass is almost absent, high tones are cut and middle tones are bit muffled.

If only the cord would last.,"PRO<br />First headphones I've ever owned that stayed in my ears.<br />Sound quality is fine for the normal human being who enjoys good music.<br /><br />CON<br />The cord is cheap and flimsy. The first cord lasted 8 months, the second cord only about 3 months. Both cords faulted in the same place--right at the edge of the harder rubber at the plug end.<br /><br />OTHER INFO<br />People who complain about the plastic falling apart, or about them being uncomfortable, or whatever else, just don't know how to follow directions. If you put these in actual boiling water, and then try to mold right away, it won't work. After they start to cool, the plastic is like old gum (but not really sticky) and is easy to mold for about 10 seconds. If you mess it up, or its uncomfortable, you'll have to try again. It took me 3 tries to get a truly comfortable fit that also stayed in without any trouble. But I thought it was well worth the effort to try it a few different times. One ear was easier than the other, probably because I'm right handed.<br /><br />However, the cord doesn't last. And I never dropped my phone or anything. Just having the cord bouncing around while running was enough to wear out the cord. I'll be looking into the headphones that are listed as compatible and seeing if I can use the molded plastic with better quality/sturdier ear buds.",2015-08-22

We use only two inputs, one from our Comcast box, and one from our BluRay player.  For our two outputs, we have a TV immediately above the box, and we have a TV on the wall in the kitchen which requires a 75 ft HDMI cable to reach it.  It works perfectly, no problem picking up signal from the switch to the kitchen TV at all.  We did buy a reasonable quality HDMI cable for such a long run.  I haven't tried the spdif, I just don't have anything that uses it at the moment.  I tested the control and it works fine, although we typically only switch when we use the BluRay player, and thus do that by hand when we're putting a disc in the BluRay player.<br /><br />I'm currently trying to figure out how to use one of these to snake my Comcast signal down to the basement and my projector system with another extra long cable.

The wood is toned to look like walnut.<br /><br />I forget that I'm wearing these in ear monitors; they are that small, comfortable, and lightweight. The braided cord does transmit a little noise into the headphones when I move the cable around a lot (these are probably not good for runners). Sitting in an airplane or at home listening to music, they work perfectly.<br /><br />At the current price of $25, I never expected these to be very good. At that price, they should be only as good as those free headphones that come with phones or music players. They are way better than their price point. If you are looking for really good headphones at a really good price - this is the pair to buy.<br /><br />There is an in line mic and a button on the left cable. A single press of the button pauses or plays music. Two presses summons Siri on an iPhone. There is no track or volume control on the in line mic.<br /><br />For this price, these are well worth a try. To me they sound wonderful. A really great value.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for review.",2015-03-19

To give greater range I had added a leaf-style window antenna via a splitter. So I looked for an omni-directional as a replacement. I did not have high hopes for this antenna at only $15. However, the quality was very impressive -- much better than the $85 antenna it was replacing. The antenna assembled easily and clamped to the existing pole mount from the prior antenna. the performance was so good I was able to eliminate the leaf antenna, splitter, amp and related cables.

The usual audiophile term is &#34;involving&#34; --- these speakers really communicate the soul of the music in a way that more analytical speakers just can't...instruments and voices sound just right, rather than making you aware that you are merely listening to them being rendered by a pair of speakers.  And yes, they are nicely forgiving of less than pristine recordings.  Their laid-back and warm sound signature also does well in a highly reflective room, i.e. one with hardwood and/or ceramic tile floors.<br /><br />They do open up nicely after the first 20 hours, so don't jump too quickly to a judgement.  Initially I set them on &#34;small&#34; on my receiver, which means all content under 80Hz was being sent to my subwoofer, because this seemed to result in a more airy, less congested sound.  After a week or two, I changed the setting to &#34;large&#34; which means 100% of the signal was going to speakers, and the congestion was gone.  My subwoofer is now set on 1 (goes up to 10) because these speakers do such an excellent job of delivering satisfying bass down to about 50Hz, which is where most of the bass in most music is anyhow.  With some types of music, such as vocal jazz, I actually turn off the subwoofer entirely.<br /><br />If your primary usage is home theater and gaming, you might prefer a more accurate/analytical/detailed speaker.  But if musical enjoyment is your main thing, these speakers are excellent...on par with $600-900 speakers like the Polk LSi bookshelves, but easier to drive: you won't need any pricey super high powered amp to get the most out of them.  And the curved cabinets are quite attractive, looking like more expensive speakers...lots of WAF bonus points, heh.",2015-06-02

It's in my attic next to my HDTV antenna, and I wanted to set it up and forget about it.  A booster is not going to perform an HDTV signal miracle for you.  If your antenna is not located in a spot to get some signal to start with, this booster won't help.  However, this booster will compensate for a long run of coax and multiple splitters connected between your antenna and your TV's.  If you boost a clean signal, right as it comes off the antenna, it will travel farther through your wiring with more usable signal at the end (your TV).  Every foot of cable and every splitter = signal lost.  The 15 dB boost was good enough for me to overcome the losses from a 60' coax run from my antenna in the attic, plus two splitters, to feed two TV's and my FM receiver.  I happen to have a 120V outlet in my attic, and was able to connect this with a short extension cord.  If you have no electric outlets near your antenna, you'll need a different type of booster - the kind with two parts - a power injector module (near your TV) and an amp (goes near the antenna).  Spend a few minutes planning your installation and buy the right type of signal booster.",2015-03-27

THis speaker can run, literally, for ever if you leave it plugged in. It plays while charging or when fully charged when plugged in, and 3) It has the rather unique design feature of kicking sound out of both front and back at the same time.

I bought mine directly through Fluance because you get the lifetime warranty then (they also will have discounts from time to time).  I use mine as a computer speaker.  I do not think a lot of people use it for this so i was a bit worried hooking it up would be a nightmare.  Turned out to be pretty easy.  I bought a blue tooth chip (plugs into USB port) for my windows 7 rig.  The brand name is Satechi (sold here on amazon).  After a 40 or so cuss words I finally got it to work.  My main issue was removing all the other default audio settings for the computer.  The computer kept wanted to send sound through the monitor or headphones (you need to go into the volume settings and just delete those options).  I originally set my bluetooth speaker to default but some applications kept leeching onto the headphone settings (especially video games).  If you have any questions just comment and i should get an email and will gladly help you out.  Since the initial setup i have had not problems.  I simply turn on the computer, switch on my bluetooth speaker, and wait for the beep boop sound.  When i decide to play Counter Strike Source with music playing in the background i have no issues.  It works like I have a hard speaker wire plugged in.  I chose bluetooth over regular computer speakers because this has 10 times more uses.  If I want to use it at the cabin I just unplug it and run off.  If i bought computer speakers they would only work on the computer and they would end up just getting tossed after a few years.  What a waste!!  The biggest con I can see with this is that it is not battery powered.  If you HAVE to have portability for your bluetooth speaker; this one would be a no go.  I hate camping and being away from electricity and running water so this will never be a problem for me.  I use this in my office, probably the size of most people's closets.  Its a small room (maybe 6x10) but when I am playing music i can hear it anywhere in my 700 sq ft apartment.  Sound really travels on this thing.  The bass is not bad.  I have a separate home audio system for serious music listening but if I am playing video games or cruising them internets, this works better than any computer speakers I've ever heard (not that I am big on the computer audio scene).  I like metal, country, rock, and a handful of rappers.  They all sound great.  I have yet to test it against my dad's bose soundlink but i am sure mine would win with audio.  His would obviously win with portability.  Audio is a very touchy subject but the VALUE is here.  I would pay $200 for this honestly.  If this was the same price as the bose soundlink I would still go with this.  Again, it depends on your lifestyle and what you want to use it for.  Do yourself a favor and buy direct from Fluance.  They make a good product and I would feel guilty giving amazon 20% of their cut.  EDIT: Today after I wrote my review i played must at 80-90% volume and noticed that the speaker freaks out after a few hours.  It starts to buzz loudly out of nowhere.  This is a definite con.  This is not a deal breaker but please be careful... the buzzing noise is very loud and obnoxious.  2ND EDIT: After the whole buzzing noise issue over Bluetooth I bought an auxiliary cable for the computer.

This mechanism is oddly placed too close to the input jack...and is really quite large and a bit awkward,  There is no good way to neatly pack up these headphones due to that big piece.  It comes with a case so you can just stuff it in there, but I was caught off guard by that mechanism. I find that a poor design flaw.  But generally happy overall. Would I buy these again? Maybe...

My first impression was that it was &#34;too nice&#34; as if trying to distract me from the product itself. I've purchased items before that ended up being so cheap that I would be willing to bet the packaging cost more to make than the product itself. However, upon handling the product I loved the feel and look of it. Short of the cables, there are no plastic parts on these earphones. The design is sleek and sturdy. The headphones are all wood and metal and they have a very high quality feel to them. After 3 weeks of using them and constantly throwing them in my pockets, the product is holding up great. The design of the cable is one of the better &#34;no tangle&#34; designs I've ever owned. When the cable does get tangled, it's a breeze to untangle. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of over the ear hooks,however, these are so well done that they are a minor distraction. After three weeks the hooks are growing on me, so I'm not sure now if I would rather have them without the ear hooks. The most important part along with the quality and feel of the product is the sound. The Rock Jaw Kommand puts out a dynamic and clear sound that doesn't distort even at a higher volume level. The other thing I love about these earphones is the fact that you can tune them with the included sound filters which can be changed out by simply screwing and unscrewing them. There is a Low filter (bass boost), Neutral filter and a High filter (enhanced mid and highs). I prefer the bass boost because nothing much is lost from the mids and highs. The bass is noticeably more prominent without sounding distorted and without sacrificing clarity of mids an highs. The sound is always crisp, clear and rich. One last thing is the rubber tips. They are very good and great. They are very good at isolating you and keeping out outside sound. The rubber tips are GREAT at staying in place. One of my biggest issues with in-ear phones is that I constantly loosethe tips from moving them in and out of my pockets, however these tips are so well built and  have such a secure fit that even trying to remove them on purpose is difficult.  The only thing I would improve on is the in-line mic and remote. I'd like to be able to control volume and not just pause and play. The mic works great from what I'm told. I like the Rock Jaw Kommand better than my old Shure SE215.",2015-07-16

A real pocket-sized radio.,"Recieved the KA200 radio bought from Electronnix a day earlier than expected.  I popped some cheap AAA batteries in it and went down the dial on both bands and was quite surprised at at the reception on slide dial a little longer than 1 inch.  The tuning dial is nice and firm most likely to prevent drift.  The volume dial is a little less firm, and may be OK that way since it is located on top of the radio.  The telescopic antenna is only about 7 inches long but seems adequate to pull in local FM stations.  The ferrite antenna for AM seems quite good to pull in stations.  Even though it states it in the description, this radio does not include the extended AM; mine won't tune past 1610 kHz.  The tuning light is a bonus and works well on both bands.<br /><br />The sound from the small speaker sounds good at a relatively close distance; tested in a 15x15 room at medium volume and it was more than adequate.  Plugged in some headphones and receive sound from both left and right, albeit mono.  Reception via headphone cord seemed as good or better than using the antenna extended and sound coming from the radio's speaker.<br /><br />Please note my test was at approximately 1pm indoors and received all local stations on both bands.  I expect night reception to be better especially on the AM band, but it may not be what you would call a good distance listening radio.  I will update at a later time.<br /><br />The radio seems to be built well and should last years.  The only quibble I have is the telescopic antenna has a small divot which may prove to be a failure point in the future (bending).  Also, as reviewed previously the base of the radio will permit the radio to stand upright, but any little wobble of the surface it's sitting on or the slightest breeze will make it fall.<br /><br />I chose this instead of the newer KA210 because I needed a tiny AM/FM to use at work to catch evening ballgames.  I have other radios with Weather Band (two of which are Kaito) and it wasn't needed for my intended use.  From reading reviews on the KA210, I believe the KA210 is bigger and through Amazon it is more expensive.<br /><br /> All said I think this a great purchase, and the price was right.ing reviews on the KA210, I believe the KA210 is bigger and through Amazon it is more expensive.

Had hopes to get local network affiliates.  I was greatly suprised to get over 30 channels here in the Atlanta Area.  Some HD music channels came in!  Instillation was easy.  I attached the cable wire to the input, utilized the included adhesives to attach the antenna to the back of the cabinet we have the TV standing on, and was upset to get no signal.  THEN, I realized I had to change my antenna settings on the TV to Air instead of Cable. I was lucky for my TV to be facing the main direction of towers.Ran the quick scan and got lots of channels. Some were very esoteric.  An old time movie channel, an Arabic channel, and even some kid's channels.  The affiliates ABC, NBC, CBS, and PBS were as good as cable.",2015-03-19

Use of this adapter allowed me to move a cabinet two inches the wall without bending the coax cable coming out of an exterior wall.

Hehe. These I believe are probably the most amazing headphones I have ever used in my entire life. I bought these for gaming and at home listening and I do not regret purchasing these at all. As a big fan of story in video games the ability to become completely immersed in the game world's sound is something I will never take for granted. These headphones make me feel as if I am right there in the game. Whether it be the sounds of a weapon firing, swords clashing, people playing music or talking, I feel like I am there to witness it all! From a musical standpoint these headphones offer what I'm looking for, consistency. I listen to a vast ocean of different musics and I have yet to encounter a genre I couldn't enjoy on these headphones. Classical tunes sounds superb with what feels like your own at home orchestra right next to you, stringed instruments in my favorite traditional Eastern Asian songs sound clear as if someone is strumming them right behind me, bass is very good for an open back headphone in more intense genres like Electro House and orchestral pieces with more stressful bass to them. Vocals also sound fantastic without anything else overpowering them, but the vocals also don't sound so prominent that I can't hear the other sounds. I just can't get over the flat and perfect sound signature these things have. They are also extremely comfortable and I can wear them for hours without my ears getting sore or my head getting sweaty or warm. They are the headphones for me specifically. These are a master of all trades pair of headphones and I recommend them to anyone who wants consistent sound. The only nitpick I could say honestly is the earmuffs attract a little bit of dust and hair but that isn't a big issue.",2015-07-21

These earbuds are in every way better than the ones that came with the Sony MP3 player I bought them for. They fit more comfortably in the ear, don't slip out as my others always tended to do, and I can't say enough about the external noise cancellation. With the Sony model I had to turn the volume way high to hear the music over the engine noise when I rode the bus, and mowing the yard they were completely useless. The difference with these is jaw dropping. Also, they have a 'patented tangle-proof cable'. I wondered exactly how they could pull that off, but it's true, so there is one less huge annoyance to deal with everytime I go to plug in.<br /><br />I'm not an affiliate, and I don't generally make this kind of recommendation, but for the price you will be amazed at the sound produced by these earbuds. Buy these. You'll love them. BTW, they ship from China, but I got them in something like 8 days.",2015-06-26

The assembly guide sheets are very confusing at first, second, and third glance, until you realize you'll have to take your time to look at it very carefully, to figure out the exact mounting setup you need to go by. While I can see that they were created in a way to live up to the &#34;Universal&#34; status, more detailed instructions would have helped, whether by words, or by diagrams.<br /><br />With this being mounted right over the end of my studio's twin bed, I took advantage of every, single screw-hole available on the mounting plate, though I had to buy the extra screws and anchors for this purpose. Even extending the mounting plates as far as they go, I barely had enough room to squeeze-in my 55 lb tower, which being a re-furb already had quite a few dents and scratches; but this was actually quite the workout to do, and NOT something I would even TRY doing with a brand new CPU, that was the same size.<br /><br />So though I made it work to suit my purpose, with 2 extra purchased shelf-brackets supporting it for my own sense of security, it was no easy task, and this CPU holder was clearly NOT made for older, or customized CPU's that would be wider by design.<br /><br />So I'm giving this product 3 stars, since they stand for &#34;it's okay&#34;, which is my exact opinion, though I should add that I would make it 2 and a half stars, IF that option was available, here.",2015-04-18

My goal was to provide a base foundation to my whole house speaker system. This unit works great.  It was easy to set up and easy to pair with the transmitter.  To be frank, the most difficulty I had was determining which output from my amplifier to use as input to the transmitter to get the sub-woofer to work.  The speaker outs did not work, I ended up using my record out jacks, and now it works great!  The transmitter is about 30-35 feet away and around a corner.  Additionally, the reason I tried blue tooth was that when I try using traditional wireless speakers I get a great deal of interference from other equipment in my home.  No such problem here.  I heartily endorse this product...works as advertised!",2015-01-30

So what do you do when you don't want to crank it and still have full sound? The best solution I've found is to download and install an equalizer app, of course this is only viable for phones, tablets, and computers. The equalizer will allow you shape the sound to match your music style and also compensate for the inefficiency of small speakers to fill the lower frequencies at lower volumes. It's nice that Skiva has opted not to pre-shape your sound for you, but this will also produce some lackluster results for many people, when they compare this to other speaker systems. It would be nice if Skiva would provide an equalizer app with some nice presets in all the app stores to overcome that. I was pretty impressed that this thing is pretty capable of handling bass boost and it sounds much more complete when it is applied. Also note that this speaker sounds more full when it's back is placed against the wall, I'm guessing the plastic cabinet is not really efficient at focusing the sound forward, but that is not uncommon among these portable speakers.  Also note that the first one that I had received was defective out of the box and displayed just a purple light in the front, no sound was produced, and it refused to even turn off when the manual switch was turned off.  So there may be some duds out there but that is to be expected with any electronic product. Amazon return authorization was straight forward and simple as always.",2015-05-26

It seems to use the &#34;other&#34; USB-mini. Looks like there's a USB-mini 'A' and 'B'.  'A' seems to be the one that most phones use. 'B' seems to be the one that this device uses. That means I have ANOTHER cable that's always lying around instead of one cable for my phone, Moto 360, and shower speaker (this). That's not the biggest of deals and it's mentioned in the description but at the same time I don't see why they would pick this type of USB. At first thought I figured this was petty to complain about but with a device that really only has one feature (making noise) I guess it's a pretty big deal. Since I will be charging it frequently I will be encountering this &#34;issue&#34; a lot. They also include a cable that is USB to Usb-mini/audio, another audio cable, and a case. I'm not sure why everyone feels the need to include a carrying case/bag with their item. I just bought a power supply last week that had a case. Seems excessive. Anyway, I'd rather they spend that money on making a better product than including more useless cables. All in all, it's not a bad buy for $15. Can't say I'd buy it again because of the uncommon USB-mini configuration port but for $15 it's really not bad.<br /><br />Before this I had that Kinivo ZX100 Mini Portable Speaker. It was good for 2 years (every day use) until the audio cable became damaged. In my eyes, 2 years of constant use is acceptable for a $20 device.",2015-02-07

Of course they don't last as long as name brand batteries you'll pay 5 or 6 times more for; they're intended for use in low drain devices as clearly noted on the package. I've found many uses for them.<br /><br />I have a bunch of rechargeable AA batteries but I still forget to charge them.  I keep these batteries on hand for those instances and more.  These batteries work well in remote controls, small clocks, small battery powered toys and more. I use them in wireless headphones, wireless keyboards and more.  As I said they have a shorter lifespan than regular use batteries but I still find they last much longer than I'd expect from batteries I bought for $1.00 at my local Dollar Tree store.<br /><br />Sunbeam AA batteries have saved my son and I many times when our Xbox One and Xbox 360 controllers go dead in the middle of a match.  I hate the Play and Charge kits and prefer to just use AA batteries.  On many occasions we've realized we have no AA batteries charged when our controller batteries go dead during the middle of an online multiplayer game. We keep at least a half pack of these AA batteries close to our Xbox controllers just in case!<br /><br />These batteries are perfect for giving to my son to use in the endless amounts of battery powered gadgets he uses and plays with.  I got very tired of replacing expensive rechargeable AA batteries that were lost because my son chose to put them in something without my knowledge.  I simply buy 4 or 5 packs of these at a time and keep them in a drawer. These also work great as a precaution around the Holidays. At Christmas I buy a few packs of every battery available from Sunbeam at my local Dollar Tree. This ensures I'll likely have batteries for that new toy, gift or gadget that comes &#34;batteries not included.&#34;<br /><br />I rate these 4 out of 5 only because I've noticed these batteries tend to leak more easily than other brands if they sit for a long time in a toy unused.

I had grown tired of the artificially boosted bass of the recent closed back offerings in the mid to high price range. The highs seem to be throttled back on most of them and the upper range, both mids and highs are muddied by the abnormal bass response of most of them. After a lot of looking, I had narrowed it down to these or the Audio Technica ATH-AD900X. These being half the price, and the great reviews weren't the only factors I considered. The cord not being easily replaceable on the Audio Technica was a major deciding factor, too. Over 90% of the headphone problems I have ever had have been cord related. The earpads not being easily replaceable was in my opinion not as much of a concern. The sound of these right out of the box is nothing short of amazing, and I know it is just going to get better with burn in. The build quality is not &#34;bulletproof&#34;, but quite good at the pricepoint. The set I received don't have the problem some describe of the slider not being tight enough on one side. The detents on both sides lock in nicely and with pretty much equal tension. The fit is fabulous, At first I thought they were too loose on my head, but even with minimal pressure, they do not move around on my head. They're lightweight and you can almost forget you have them on. The soundstage doesn't seem as wide as I had imagined it would be, but they are still very airy and open sounding. If you are into bass heavy hip hop type music, these are probably not for you, but the bass is all there and definitely not lacking. Very natural sound across the whole sound spectrum. The best purchase I have made in some time. I am using an amp with them and haven't tried them out without it, but as efficient as they are I would expect good performance straight from a portable device without it.",2015-08-11

Too tight!,"I've had these for about 2 weeks, and though I'm definitely no audiophile, the sound quality seems pretty good.  The noise cancellation seems excellent.  My only reason for the poor rating is that they are WAY TOO SMALL!  I have a pretty normal size adult head.  Not too small, definitely not abnormally large.  These headphones are extremely tight fitting and uncomfortable.  I could tolerate them for about a half an hour, and then found myself taking a break to rest my tortured calvarium.  They are both too tight, resulting in an uncomfortable skull squeezing sensation, and too small, in that the band does not expand enough and ends up pressing on the top of my head.  While these are far from the most costly of headphones, they are pricey enough that I don't think it would have been too much to ask to allow for a little more breathing room to accomodate the full range of normal, non-mutant-supervillain head sizes.",2015-01-24

They received maybe two hours of use a week and the rest of the time were kept tucked away in a drawer.

Prior to that, the little round plastic pieces on the outside of the headphones that make them look like Beats knock-offs that they are came unglued and fell off.<br /><br />The sound quality was okay, and they were comfortable if you wore them for half an hour at a time or less. If you wore them longer than that, the ear cups were too shallow and ended up causing discomfort as they pressed your ears against your head. Also, the cable is a little on the short side, though manageable.<br /><br />Overall, even for a $12 pair of headphones they aren't worth the money.

Ordered again and port door had a better fit and stayed in place, sound is good, seems to be well built, I like the design, however the led/light stays lit in red instead of blinking alternating between red/blue as manual states, so there is no way to tell when the unit is actually charged. Customer service replied to my concern promptly and said blue light was very faint when charging, but there is no blue light at all even in a room with all lights off; blue light does work as it lights when the unit is first turned on and the unit is pairing. Unit is going back. **** UPDATE: after being contacted by customer service I'm updating my review to 4 starts; the issue with the led not blinking is expected behavior, however the manual does say it blinks alternately between red/blue, but that is only if the speaker is ON while charging. If the speaker is of then the led will remain a solid red, and then change to a solid blue when full. This is not covered in the manual thus leading to the confusion. Having this squared away I'm giving it 4 stars, discounted one because of the port latch which seems to be a common issue after reading more reviews, and because the manual does not cover the led behavior while charging the unit turned off. And a kudos to their customer service for following up with my concerns immediately.",2015-06-04

I was a previous owner of several pairs of S4's, both versions. I have to say that the bass is quite heavily emphasized, but to me it feels like the sound is very immediate. It's certainly very tight sounding, despite being louder. Overall I found the sound quality improved over the S4's and I don't find my ears fatiguing as much as they did previously. I also found myself fitting the buds in my ears better than my previous ones, which is a little weird, and probably a response to them being a bit longer. The length might be a problem if you like to wear your headphones under a helmet. The main issue i have with the headphones overall is there is substantially more cable friction noise than any of the previous headphones I've owned. They really need to ship with a clip to hold them still. I either have to hold on to the cable with my hand while i'm walking, or twist it around a button or something. It's a bit annoying.<br />Overall though, definitely a tangible upgrade to my old S4's. Recommended.",2015-05-15

Sure, you could control your fan speeds through bios, but not every board has that ability. Plus it's impossible to do if you're trying to change your speeds on the fly.<br />It's small, easily hidden behind many mobo trays, or near the top/bottom of the case.<br />It comes with velcro pads, and they're  hard to pry apart, so I doubt they'll fail you. They're  not the usual hook-loop type of velcro, but some weird hook-hook hard plastic hybrid.<br />It's also kind of small, so you barely notice it in your case.<br />The program that you run it with is pretty nice, but it is the weakest link for this product. While it let's you create a variable profile to ramp up/down your fans at certain temp readings, the polish leaves a little to be desired. Also, if you want a smooth transition from low RPM to high RPM, be prepared to be in the interface for a while. You have to plot each point to make it go up or down smoothly. That's the reason for 1 less star.<br />I still like it though. When I do my next build, I'll get this controller again, or the next one in line if this is not being made anymore.",2015-06-25

I have a fair amount of experience with professional audio gear. As a kid my first job was installing car stereo systems while I was in school.  I am also a musician.  I have several bluetooth speakers that are ok for what they are. I also have a nice home stereo system and well as a home theater system.  I wanted something portable that was balanced, provided good quality and features. I wanted something with good build quality and most of all I did not want something cheap that claimed deep bass and great range when most of these devices fall short. I have to say this is with out any doubt the best purchase I have ever made.  The design is fantastic. The sound quality totally surpassed by expectations. Just pairing it with my phone showed me right away it had potential. It was later after i Connected it to my PC via USB and Downloaded the software from Creative that I found this box to be magical. I was able to fine tune everything you would ever need to touch including the crossover frequency as well as an EQ.  No it will not replace even an 8 inch sub but it does a fantastic job on the low end. More so than any speaker I have seen in its class. Yes i looked at the Bose product line. Not a thing in the world wrong with them, except the price.  I found the closest Bose speaker to the Roar to be a bit challenged with dynamic range and it just did not have the extra power that the Roar has. The versatility alone makes this a huge buy at its price. You can use this in the place of a soundbar for your TV if you really wanted to. Honestly it kills my $450 Soundbar so I Think I will get another Roar.  Being able to use this as a speaker phone, and charge other devices is a nice feature. The ability to use a SD card is another well thought out feature. The device does really well on its on, but if you want it to really punch you should leave it plugged in.  There is a difference. I very impressed. The only Con I found is the botom has 2 rubber strips, which is great! The bottom is also aluminum that scratches easy. I already scratched it, but that is cosmetic so not really a big deal. NFC is nice and having USB audio connectivity is huge. There is also an analog input that does very well for devices that don't have Bluetooth. This is a very solid feeling product.  The voice prompts are a bit muffled IMO but that is just me.  If you get one of these, Plug it into your PC and install the software from Creative, Let it run the demo video.  My entire desk was shaking.  That was when I said, uhh I need more of these..........LOL.  VERY happy with this especially for the price.  I have a fair amount of gear from Creative,  And yes, they have built great sound cards and some mediocre stuff in the past, This is NOT one of them.  If your looking at the Bose product in the same price range, Go listen to this thing seriously.  It will likely change your mind.",2015-06-04

The total distance including wall and ceiling mounted LAN jacks ended up around 30-35'. A new power outlet was needed for the projector and the power and Cat6 cables run close together for about 8-10'. The Cat6 cables are unshielded.<br /><br />The second install connected a PC in a home office to TV in an adjoining bedroom. The total run is about 25'. Also using unshielded Cat6 cable.<br /><br />The issue with both setups is the signal is disrupted for maybe a second or less when a motor starts. We are talking motors which require a high starting current like an air conditioner or a refrigerator. The HDMI system immediately does a new 'handshake' and everything is back to normal.<br />The offending motors do not have to be on the same circuit. The AC can be a whole house unit. The refrigerator can be on a separate line in another room. And it doesn't happen 100% of the time, only rarely. The 100% reproducible disruption is when a ceiling fan in the bedroom installation is switched on. That fan is on the same circuit as the PC and the TV.<br /><br />Other than this issue, both units work fine. I suspect that using shielded Cat6 might be a solution but the glitch occurs so infrequently I'm not sure it is worth experimenting with new cables. Overall I'm very pleased with this product. Even with the issue noted I'll still give it 5-stars.",2015-05-22

Neither the Bose Quiet Comfort nor the Beats Studio wireless were comfortable. Had the Bose been comfortable, I would have preferred its feature set over these. The Beats had an incessant hum in the right ear which was a deal breaker.<br /><br />While these are keepers, I do not think they are 5-star worthy mainly because they do not look like and are not built like $300 headphones.<br /><br />But what I DO like about them is that they are comfortable, and I can wear them for hours without ear discomfort. The sound quality is excellent, though it could be louder, as many other reviewers have pointed out. One of the best features is that it has a replaceable battery that can be charged in or outside of the headphones. I bought a second battery, so I can always have one charging while the other is in use.<br /><br />The sound quality for phone calls could be better. The Bose Quiet Comfort were the best in that department. However, it is still very good, and I've only had one phone call that I couldn't use them, because I was unable to hear what the other person was saying.<br /><br />I like the forward and reverse controls on the 550-X better than both the Bose and the Beats. With the 550-X, it is one press to go in either direction, because there is a dedicated spot on the switch for the control.

I purchased these for a Christmas present for my husband because he likes to  watch television when I'm trying to go to sleep. Well, I really purchased them for him to use for me and I could not have been more pleased. My husband started out using them with his phone and was happy with the sound quality and volume. His old pair were ancient and they looked ridiculous with the wires hanging from it to his phone. The reviews helped me make the decision to buy these wireless headphones and I figured that I can add to the positive insight for someone else. When he finally relented and decided to try the headphones with the television, we could not believe how well it worked. He could walk all over the house and the sound/quality did not diminish. You have to mute the television if you do not want to hear it without the headphones though. The only problem that we encountered, which is more due to our model television than anything, is the RCA hook up to our television. We had to buy a special RCA adapter and then connect the receiver to the correct audio output hookups on the TV. Anyway, turned out well and we're still very happy with the purchase.",2015-02-06

The Cables 2 Go 41082 I was using before ran out with one more end to make and, though they worked fine, I tried this brand during a re-order.<br /><br />These C&E 75564 crimp connecters do not seem to crimp well.  The metal actually buckled into a fin, unlike the other two brands I had used previously.  I cut off the first attempt (where I had crimped from the middle of the connector back out towards the end where the wire was inserted, as I'd learned to do) and tried again with another connector and crimped starting from the wire end.  This time it still made a &#34;fin&#34; but at least it didn't crack the metal.  I'm sure it'll make a passable connection to the shielding for the one end I still had remaining to do, but I'd be pretty disappointed if I needed the full pack for this project as the others crimped far better.<br /><br />I've attached a picture of the first end, where I had crimped starting from the middle of the connector.",2015-06-21

I've experienced absolutely no problems with them.  I work in a very loud place and I can still hear my music through everything while still being able to hear necessary surrounding noise.  I wear them for seven hours a day and they don't irritate my ears at all.  I thought I would need the smallest tip but it's actually too small for my ears so I use the medium and the large.  The tips are silicon and fit inside the ear very snuggly and do not move.  The sound is great; I enjoy the bass that comes through with some songs and the undertones I never noticed before.  The mic works great.  I thought it stopped working at one point but simply unplugging and plugging the jack back in got it to work again.  These headphones work with HTC OneRemix Android phone and my iPod touch 4th gen.  I know some people have had issues with these headphones but they're just like anything else - sometimes there are a few bad ones in the bunch but one experience doesn't apply to them all.  Just something to keep in mind when purchasing anything really.  Hope this review helps some people!,2015-04-26

Having them on sounds like pressing the &#34;loud&#34; button that stereos from the past had. The sound is just more robust. I'm not an audiophile, so I'm not going to share my opinion(s) about the SoundSport's range(s). Definitely less sound leakage out, but, more importantly, less sound coming in.<br /><br />I subtracted a star because the (0030) are LARGE, but they're not as large as the SoundSport's packaged Large. These replacement (0030)-L are comparable to the mediums that come with the SoundSports. I assumed that the earphone molds would all be the same, but maybe it varies from model-to-model...technically, I should have bought them for their intended models, right...? So a suggestion to myself would be to use the replacement Large for studying and sleeping (as knocking it off my ears wouldn't be that big of a deal), and use the packaged Large for &#34;sports&#34; as they are well more secure and will allow me to hear danger if that danger happens to make noise.",2015-04-07

I have well over 30 channels even though I don't use all of the channels due to duplications or content, I have a range of 100 miles between broadcast points of channels available to choose from.<br /><br />I have this antenna in a window facing south and the furthest channel received south (low population area) is about 40 miles. Surprisingly even with a southern facing, I am getting stations (high population area) 60 miles north. I live in a private home on a wooded lot in an area with rolling hills.<br /><br />I decided to try a thin antenna that can mount to a window rather than continuing using an amplified large rabbit ear style antenna with a new HDTV purchased. Rabbit ear antenna was out of place with the new thin Smart HDTV.  The first thin antenna I purchased was a MOHU Leaf amplified 60 mile range antenna. I mounted the MOHU in the window and got all but one channel group that my rabbit ear antenna got. Trying to get the missing channe groupl, while plugged into the TV with power on I tried to move the MOHU to a different location on the window and I got a shock (static?) and the MOHU stopped sending any signal to the TV. I returned the MOHU to WalMart and decided to try this Amazon amplified antenna. I am very satisfied with this product and after selecting a location in the window, the channels now received surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />The only plus for the MOHU is that it had 4 velcro pads to attach to a wall or window. The Amazon Basic Amplified only has two 3M tapes and depending how you mount the antenna two may not be enough. I mounted this antenna with the cable at the top of the window to eliminate the cord being too visible.(running the cable around the window frame) With only two 3M tapes, the power connection (cable) did not hold flush to the window. I happened to have a few of the 3M tapes lying around so it was an easy fix for me. Eventually if there is a problem due to radiant heat from the southern exposure, I may change to four velcro pads. I think Amazon assumes that the antenna would only be mounted withe the cable at the bottom of the antenna and two 3M tapes may be enough.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone wanting to get rid of the older rabbit ear style antennas or are just not satisfied with their current digital channel reception.adiant heat from the southern exposure, I may change to four velcro pads.

45130461,R3IWDU32MG1JTC,B00HHTD1Q2,953732012,Sennheiser Momentum Headphone,Electronics,2,3,5,N,Y,I am dissapoint.,"Notes:  Leather-like ear pads, Headphones listed as &#34;Over the Ear&#34;<br /><br />I agree with a majority of the assessments made on these headphones-the ear cuppage (both major and minor axis of an ellipse shape) are too small to be considered &#34;Over the ear.&#34;  What ends up happening is that ear pads (leather) end up resting on the ears and actually impart a small lateral deflection of the Helix of the ear.<br /><br />I had like so many others read the description and complaints here on amazon about how the headphones are not true &#34;Over the ear&#34; but rather are &#34;on the ear&#34; headphones.  I believe there is some confusion (because I think some listing here on amazon specifically state &#34;over the ear&#34; or &#34;on the ear&#34; - but I think the only differences is the material used on the ear pads themselves - not the size.  I'll leave it to the reader to find the examples here on Amazon because frankly I've already spent too much time on this review.<br /><br />To be honest I really wanted to like these because to me they are very nice looking, look light and have a clean lines  - but after about 20 minutes my left ear started to ache.  I tried to power though it &#34;like a man&#34; because they are so cool, but  after about an additional 10 minutes of listening to music I ended up crying in pain (not really-just dissapointed).  I just figured I'd spend my hard earned cash on another set of headphones....<br /><br />Please note that I do not have dumbo like ears, nor do I have elven or spock like ears.  I would say I am +/- 1 standard deviation on a bell curve in ear size.  I do not have bell curve data on ear location on the head, but rest assured I have 1 on each side (left and right).",2015-03-21

I have always been an insomniac and a light sleeper.  I share an open-floor plan apartment with a partner who stays up late.  As you can imagine, this creates some challenges.  For a long time I used external white noise makers-- both a free standing machine and an app on my iPad.  These weren't too bad, but with the open floor plan, they really didn't block out the noise entirely.  I also tried using a white noise app with regular headphones on my iphone. But this also was not the best solution.  The regular headphone were uncomfortable and would often fall out.  After one particularly bad night's sleep I googled for advice about how to sleep better, and an article recommended these headphones.  I am sleeping so much better since I've started using these!  The headphones are comfortable and for me a good weight. (Another reviewer mentioned that they were a bit warm for him because they are made out of a fleece type fabric, but they work for me.  I tend to be on the cold side though).  The speakers are inside the band, and sometimes I have to jiggle them around to make sure they are over my ears.  If I really need to, I can also open up the back and stick my hand in to move them around.  Since I've started wearing them, I haven't really woken up much because of noise.  I rarely wake up when my partner comes to bed, and I don't think I can remember hearing any closing cabinet doors or microwave oven buttons since the purchase (these used to be major culrpits for waking me up!).  I liked them so much, I got my partner a pair, and he has been wearing them every night. (He even pulls the band over his eyes so it doubles as a sleep mask.  I think this would be a little too tight of a fit for me though.  I like the forty blinks eye mask).  We've been using them now for a few months, and they remain in good condition.  We have yet to try washing them though!  Overall my experience has been positive.  I honestly don't know what I would do without these (I'm even considering buying another pair so I always have a backup!)",2015-03-31

I use it between my Bada CD player and LFD NCSE model integrated amp.  I think it certainly adds a lot to the presentation (and I didn't think that possible).  It  widens the soundstage, adds some &#34;air&#34; to the presentation, and just sort of fleshes out the music.  I love it.  It runs very quiet too and the Chinese tubes are not bad at all.  So don't feel you have to buy other tubes.<br />I have some G.E. 5670 tubes in now and those are nice as well.  I wouldn't say it's a huge difference but I need to do some more serious comparisons before I decide.  I don't think you can go wrong using this as a buffer.  Somehow, using this a just a straight preamp doesn't seem to be it's strong point.  I don't know why that is, but I tried this with a straight power amp I built using a Sure Electronics TK2050 board.  I've always thought that amp was really good, but the 6N3 buffer preamp didn't seem to complement it much.  Like I say, more experimentation is necessary since I've only had this for a short time.  But I can highly recommend this buffer preamp.<br /><br />Edit/Update:  August 6, 2016.<br />OK, I've been using this continuously now since I bought it.  I do use it as a preamp with various chip and class D amps I've been experimenting with.  It continues to amaze me with its sound quality and I still highly recommend it.  Buy one!

However, the main reason why I got them is because of the noise cancellation feature and I didn't feel like breaking the bank and buying the Bose for three times the price. Note that the key word here is &#34;environmental&#34; noise. It cancels out most of things like fans, typing, cars on the outside, but it certainly won't block out the noise of somebody watching TV or talking on the phone (which what I mainly wanted). So if you are just looking for mild noise cancellation these are great, but you certainly won't be able to be silent in a room where someone is talking or listening to music.  EDIT 12/18/2015  I have had these headphone for almost a year and I have had so many problems. First, the twisting part of the cups broke on both sides (and I take care  of these headphones) and I had to superglue them. But now they don't twist and thus the case is utterly useless and I have to always keep them around my neck now. Also, the noise cancelling gives this screeching noise sometimes and when activated makes a side don't work sometimes. Don't go for these headphones unless you just care about sound quality.",2015-01-05

I should note, however, that I don't think that you can go wrong at this price point.  First of all, I love my original PX-100 (over 7 years and still going strong) as I grew up with and hence prefer the sound of an open headphone.  The main point I wish to make is that one of these is not superior to the other - they are just different sounding.  Both have good range, clarity, and depth of sound.  However, the PX-100-II certainly has a bit more bass to it (but not at bass head level).  Just a bit more boom than the original PX-100 which has a bit more treble and high end.  Personally I prefer more treble due to my perception of greater clarity with this type of sound.  So I like both of them and alternate depending on the type of music I am in the mood for.",2015-07-11

HTD in-wall/in-ceiling speakers in two homes and they're a great value. My primary use is for surrounds or ...,"I've used HTD in-wall/in-ceiling speakers in two homes and they're a great value. My primary use is for surrounds or multi-room audio distribution - not as LCRs although I'm sure they'd be just fine in smaller rooms with a good subwoofer. As with pretty much any in-wall or in-ceiling speaker, you're better off with external cabinets for the fronts and center. The surrounds don't need to be as &#34;beefy&#34; to fill out a nice theater system and don't fret too much on 6.5&#34; versus 8&#34; drivers...that extra 1.5&#34; won't impact the overall sound quality at all when used as surrounds.<br /><br />I've also used Polk, Energy and Outdoor Speaker Depot and don't have complaints about any of them. From a technical build perspecitve, I'd put Polk and HTD first, followed by OSD (seriously!) and then Energy. These speakers were added to my system as front heights and if you run Audyssey, YPAO, MCACC, they'll blend in as well as anything else. I was about to pull the trigger on HTD's Level Three towers until a desperate Craig's seller had Def Tech SuperTower STs at a price that was too good to pass. I'm also using HTD's Level Three subwoofer and it's a (beefy) workhorse. too. My theater room is about 3000 cubic feet with a Marantz SR-7008 running the show. Pun.<br /><br />HTD customer service gets an A+ rating, too. When I lost come dog ear clips during a renovation, they sent more, no quesitons asked and at no charge. They're also great with advice and installation & setup questions.<br /><br />One suggested design improvement: Allow the speaker panel to be removed from the frame. My Energy speakers have this feature and it makes painting and installation easier. HTD follows most manufacturers' lead and each speaker is basically a one-piece frame. They're still easy to mount but having removable frames makes it a little easier and painting is a breeze with this feature. It also allows you to more easily backfill a wall or ceiling cavity with sound-absorbing insulation because the dog ears often catch the insulation.<br /><br />The tweeters have a little more pivot flexibility than my other in-walls but for surround sound it's not a big deal. If you need extreme angles with your speakers, don't rely on tweeter repositioning and just buy angled in-ceilings.<br /><br />Editorial comment: If you want to get the most out of your speakers and listening room, make sure you're setting budget aside for acoustic treatments. Buy online or make your own...doesn't matter that much and DIY is quite easy. You'll improve your system's sound quality significantly by getting rid of as many reflection points as possible.<br /><br />Happy listening!",2015-04-03

I am very pleased with the sound and the value. The sound quality of this speaker is better than the sound quality to the Beats Pill but a much lower price. I am extremely surprised about the construction of it being waterproof and dustproof. This allows me to take it outdoors to activities where I know I'm going to be in the water and not worry about a thing. I highly recommend this portable speaker to others, the price cant be beat. Biggest gripe I have about Systems on the market is the bass. This speaker system blows away your mind to the amount of BASS that it has. I am super excited to have the speaker just for that very reason. And trust me it is not overpowering as it improves the overall quality I'll be sound so much more. Small unit for massive power.<br /><br />The volume that comes out of this little speaker is tremendous and I don't say the word tremendous very often but that is exactly what it is! We took this on vacation with us and it didn't take up a whole lot of space, it was the perfect way to listen to music and connect with our different devices.<br /><br />Even though it is quite small, don't let looks fool you, this speaker puts out an amazing, loud and crystal clear sound, with thumping bass. No static or fuzz. It's very easy to pair, it will work with pretty much any device. It also comes with a USB cord.<br />I'm a music nut, can live without TV and movies, but really totally enjoy music. I have always wanted nice audio, but didn't always want to spend the money on it when other things were looming. Finally I got this to review so I am very glad I got this. It is amazing. I love music, the highs, the bass, the stereo sound, all of this. I wanted something for my desk . It has the best sound of any speaker, ever. The bass is amazing, the treble is amazing, and the whole package is amazing.<br />You'll find yourself just staring at this, listening, and wondering how this little speaker can produce such great sound. It has a great battery life.<br /><br />With most Speakers, you have to face the speaker toward you to get the fullest sound from it. So I always find myself, changing the facing of speakers towards me. With this speaker it feels you're in a home theater system would sound coming from all directions.<br /><br />While I'm jamming out to my favorite song, if a call comes in, I don't have to turn the speaker off. The music will stop. It also has the volume and track keys. The speaker is very stylish. Both my android phone, iPhone and MacBook Pro were so easy to pair with this speaker.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, go for it. You won't be disappointed.

The only issue is that the reason why I purchased a cable to begin with (instead of using my adapter) was to be able to use my adjacent plugs right next to this port. This plug's micro HDMI plug is so wide, it blocks the use of the adjacent plugs! My adapter is also wide so, using that, I also can't use the adjacent ports. :(<br /><br />At least this cable worked. Had I looked at the picture beforehand, I would have NOT purchased this cable (my brother recommended it to me after I used his on a trip and it actually worked).<br /><br />The other FOUR cables I purchased were (BlueRigger 3ft, BlueRigger 6ft, Cable Matters 3ft, HD Zone's 6.4ft). None of those would work with my monitor (I think the metal contacts were too far recessed into the HDMI plug).<br /><br />I'd give this a 5 star review if it was slimmer at the micro HDMI port.

Altogether they look nice and the metal arms seem to be the answer to the previous turbines<br /><br />Sound quality:  8/10 I'm coming from Audio technica ath m50 amped with a fiio e11 as my daily headphones, these headphones out of the box sounded like other reviewers stated, muddy, and with lack of mids. As time goes on, these headphones just get better, with a decent soundstage(something you don't normally find in headphones like this) and my goodness, the bass, these will shake your head, not super deep and accurate (slight distortion, but better than anything in the price range)<br /><br />Volume: these headphones blast so loud you can use them as dedicated speakers, or give yourself permanent hearing damage<br /><br />Comfort- 8/10 the pads are nice and wrap around your ears, soft, don't make my ears sweat, the band is tight but not too tight (I have an average head) you can barely tell these are on for extended periods of time, ocxaisional discomfort on ears, maybe due to high volume. All together great for what you get, beat Ath M50s in comfort<br /><br />-better than beats (best buy trial)<br /><br />-Cons-<br />-Low volume buzz, occasional cutting out, not sure if its my note 3 or the headphones so will update eventually.<br /><br />-Pretty bad sound for the first day or two<br /><br />-Sound isolation/leak- they leak sound a little, at high volume its hard to avoid with 57mm drivers, and the cups don't make a complete seal on my ears so some sound can get in. Minor adjustments can fix this.<br /><br />The mic - Its okay, it works, I wouldn't use a mic on headphones like this to begin with but its a handy feature, quality isn't amazing but at least as good as speaker phone, not bad enough to lose a star.<br /><br />Conclusion-<br />If you are looking for headphones that you don't need a cord for, like having bass and having your music loud, or just want some cheap headphones, these are great, I can't find any great con's with these 5-star product for the price. Will update in time to reevaluate the longevity of these headphones.",2015-01-11

Game controllers, flashlights, remotes, and various things like portable soldering irons keep me constantly going through batteries. This, coupled with Amazon Basics batteries, has saved me a small fortune in batteries.<br /><br />I like that I can charge many cells at once, but as others have mentioned it does make a small whining noise while charging. Some of my friends can't hear it, but if you can hear electronics (like old tube TVs kicking on) you'll probably be able to hear this.  I keep it on a shelf out of the way where I can't hear it. In the two years I've had it I can't say I've had any complaints. It does what it's supposed to do and does it in a fairly quick manner. I can set 12 batteries in to charge before going to bed and have 12 full cells in the morning.<br /><br />While it lacks the functions of most smart chargers, it does allow you to run a full charge/discharge cycle on the batteries to recondition them. I've used this once or twice to refresh batteries and bring the capacity back up. Expect this to take about a day, as it is not a quick process.<br /><br />Keep up the good work, Tenergy! :)",2015-08-17

And I wish the earcups were larger as these aremore accurately an on ear model as opposed to over ear, and need to take a break after about 1-2 hours. Great sound quality, build quality, design, and functionality though. Totally worth the price!",2015-06-01

I had bunny ears before but honestly an eyesore. So I figured try this because it looks like a mouse pad and is not as conspicuous. Well I am thrilled to say I hooked it up and found my channels that I got before including CBS, Fox, Movies, Antenna tv which are classic shows, HSN. Then I realized I also got the CW channel. So I got an extra channel. I didn't fuss with positions and just propped it against the wall on some stacked pillows. The bonus with this antenna as opposed to bunny ears is that the stations remain constantly clear and it never requires adjustment as I had to before every so often which was frustrating. Also my bunny ears which were more expensive and HD ready made the picture choppy at times and ruined my shows. Sometimes it went back or I started repositioning. With this antenna no interference, no frustration, plenty of channels for my satisfaction and not sticking out in my face. I would buy another and its truly great and does what it says. I live in a city so I need to include that. No more cable bills. No more useless channels I don't watch. If your on a budget and want to watch some of the best shows and old movies it's perfect. I have no desire to pay for anything like Netflix because between CBS and Fox I already watch too much TV. It's definitely worth it and for the price? Omg. Wish I would have checked Amazon before Radio Shack. Lesson learned. I love the customer service. One great thing about Amazon is the friendly service agents and such easy return policies. I haven't sent much back but when I did it was a breeze. Lately, I just shop here because I get reviews, and it's saving me so much money on things that I really need. As a comparison shopper Amazon beats every store and website.",2015-04-22

To give you a relative size, each side of the triangle is about as long and a little bit wider than a dollar bill.<br /><br />❖ The sound performs great across all ranges. From lows to mids to highs, it sounded very good. Vocals are crisp and clear. You can hear clarity in the detail in the high ranges. It produces very nice sound with great reproduction of the original source. Bass comes across well with an undistorted sound even with the volume cranked up. This speaker really handles the low tones well. (This is usually where small speakers fail. It doesn't sound like professional grade concert speakers, but it's really really good for being so small.)<br /><br />❖ It's LOUD. For a small speaker with two 3W speakers in it, it's surprisingly loud. It's not going to overpower a room full of people talking like you could with a pair of high end floor speakers, but you'll still hear it's there even over a crowd. It's got some kick to it.<br /><br />❖ The NFC pairing feature works great to get it paired with a phone. I've tested many Bluetooth speakers and I've never gotten the NFC pairing to work quite right. I always have problems with it on other models. But this one worked flawlessly. I turned on the NFC feature on my phone and instantly it was paired with the speaker without any problems. I've never had that go smoothly before.<br /><br />❖ The controls work well to advance the song and such. Advancing the track is a single push, increasing volume is a long push. Same for decreasing the track and volume.<br /><br />❖ The front screen is a metal mesh that's sturdy enough to protect the speaker cones if it gets bumped hard. The rest of the housing it quite stylish and feels very sturdy. The red highlights are vibrant and sharp looking.<br /><br />❖ The travel bag that comes with it is nothing to get super excited about, but it'll do it's job to keep the speaker scratch and dirt free. You will also find in the box a USB cord for charging and an 3.5mm audio cord for connecting it to non Bluetooth devices.<br /><br />I was sent a sample of this product at no cost for the purposes of thoroughly testing and reviewing it.box a USB cord for charging and an 3.5mm audio cord for connecting it to non Bluetooth devices.

Plenty of features: Music (MP3, WAV, WMA were tested), video (AMV, but i didn't test it), ebook (prepare for and interesting reading experiences, however words in any text (.TXT) format will work), games (however see below regarding menu navigation). I would venture that this player can be best utilized as a music player during long drives. Just load the music, and let it play itself. It is NOT suited for multi-task using (no music & games at the same time).<br /><br />Externals & Menu Navigation<br />It has a good screen, but for the features offered, it's just really small. eBook reading can be a frustrating experience, and I wouldn't recommend loading any videos with a quality higher than 480p. This particular version (there is a similar version sold by another company) has 5 buttons, NO trackwheel (don't let the picture fool you), and a power switch on top. My player had the switch, but the device could also be powered off by pressing & holding for a few seconds the Play/Pause button. It seems that the switch is a hard power off, and the play/pause a soft power off??? Once the device is on, I would recommend some mindful meditation or other stress relief exercise before interacting with the device. In order to scroll up/down on the device, one would press the right/left buttons (respectively), a VERY counter intuitive idea. Think that you are going to make your selection by pressing the center button? Nope! your enter key is the MENU button. To describe folder navigation is similar. For games, Menu is up, left-left, right-right, but the center button is for down.<br /><br />Firmware & Software:<br />There is no associated software. the device is glorified thumb drive, but I think that's a plus, and was a pro that gave this 2 stars. For music: device does not show cover art, but considering my suggested use, one should NOT be looking elsewhere but the road :) . Menu navigation is frustrating at first glance, but is still quasi-easy. Pressing MENU during a song will show options, but What I noticed is that if you did not go into the folder menu the first time, and you selected play options, any subsequent attempt to reach the menu will lead you back to the settings. Press & Hold menu to return to the home screen, but your music will stop playing. Ditto for videos. I cannot find a manufacturer for this device or the firmware, so no updates, and no &#34;alternative&#34; firmware options.<br /><br />Construction & USB Port<br />Another plus is that this is made of aluminum, and it actually feels like a quality product (wish i could say the same for the firmware). The power switch is on top, headphone port (no button support), lanyard port, and USB port on the bottom. A strange quirk is that we are harking back to the days of Mini USB (usually found with digital cameras) instead of micro USB (modern phones and some other electronics). this is only an issue if you plan on using other chargers or cords to interface with the device.<br /><br />Overall, i'm glad I returned it, and chose another product. This had so much potential, but the firmware issues were just too much to deal with.",2015-08-29

36420627,RGR8TO2N8I2MX,B008D66RAU,955111030,J-Tech Digital Powered Splitter Version 1.3 Certified with Deep Color and HD Audio,Electronics,5,0,1,N,Y,It does what it needs to to.,"Update:  I originally gave it 4 stars for not sending multi-channel audio to my stereo.  It has been explained by J-Tech that the splitter defaults to the lower audio setting.  Since one of the devices on the splitter is only 2-channel, it only transmits 2-channel to my stereo also. Now that I have it splitting from the stereo to the TVs, problem solved, so upgrading to 5 stars.   I bought the J-Tech to replace the one from another vendor that turned out to be crap.  It was $5 more, but it works much better.  The other splitter kept blacking out, the power adapter was loose on the back, and the casing was loose.  This one is better constructed with a solid feel and the signal is there the whole time.  The only reason for 4 stars is that it says it says it's capable of Dolby True-HD and DTS-HD, but it only sends 2-channel stereo to my receiver from my DVR.  That's the same problem I had with the other vendor.  I realized I could solve the problem by moving the splitter from between the DVR and receiver to between the receiver and TV.  However, it still claims capability of multi-channel and I can only get 2-channel out of it, so 4 stars.  If there is someone that can solve that issue, I'll change it to 5.",2015-03-23

I don't know another soul with ear buds that are this color.  OK, now that we have that out of the way....<br /><br />These came with not one, not two, but FOUR different sizes of tips. Read the little instructional sheet that comes with them...they should fit snugly for the best sound. Played around with the different sizes and found the perfect one. These aren't noise cancelling headphones, but darned if I can hear anything external at the office when I'm plugged in. I'm betting they'll be fabulous next time I have to get on a plane. Flat cord is super & hasn't tangled once. The plug has a 90-degree, right-angle connector, so it stays pretty flat to your device & that's certainly a nice little design detail.<br /><br />Down to the nitty gritty...how to they sound? Like I said, play with the different tip sizes to find a snug, yet comfortable fit and then you'll get the best sound, IMO. Sound is good...hearing highs & lows well, picking up all of the close harmonies if there are any. These headphones have better sound than another, more expensive pair that used to be my favorites (guess it's a good thing I can't find those & was forced to get these, eh?).<br /><br />Overall...good buy. I know there are more expensive headphones out there, but these definitely have more bang for your buck. Pick a color, order them, plug them in & enjoy!",2015-07-02

These do all of that.  I have an older set of V-Modas that I liked very much, but without a volume control... and when that inevitable track came up on my iPod that was incredibly louder than the previous series of tracks, I had no recourse -- either yank the ear buds out, fumble out the iPod and change the master volume -- then have to do it again when the sound levels diminished after the loud track -- or suffer through it.  I tried Apple's ear buds -- but they won't stay in place.  On my daily hike, every 100 yards or so I have to re-insert an ear bud.  They won't stay in place - constantly work loose as I walk, as I turn my head - even if a gust of wind catches the wires right, one of them loosens and slips out of place.  But the volume control works nicely...  These V-Modas solve my problem - fit my needs.  Comfortable fit (more comfortable than my old model V-Modas)... excellent sound (for me anyway -- I am no audiophile with finely tuned ears cringing at nuances of sound, treble ranges, bass undertones... it just sounds good to me)... light-weight, and with a simple, effective volume control that quickly and easily adjusts the volume!!  Just did 4-miles at my &#34;forced march&#34; pace and never had to touch or refit an ear bud even once.  I even lowered the volume on one track, and boosted it back up for the next without breaking stride or even looking down.  Problem solved - thank you V-Moda.",2015-05-12

21340177,R3AOXAG2UKY4FA,B008S7EYW2,862075670,Composite to HDMI Converter,Electronics,4,0,0,N,Y,Great little converter,"I thought I needed it for my Fatshark video goggles to convert the output video source to my PVR, but it doesn't need it. I tried this little composite to HDMI converter out and I really like it. It works as expected, but I do have some things to mention that I don't like and what I would like to see in the future.<br /><br />I wish it had an option for 480p with the option for 720p and 1080p... just as an option so it can use the native resolution... and an option to keep either it 4:3 or 16:9 aspic ratio... Having an 4k option would be a stretch (insert pun joke here), but wouldn't really be needed.<br /><br />The video quality could be better... I notice that it has a hard time converting lighter color hues... but that's really only if you take a real close look at it. Other than that, it's not even noticeable.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe having a battery compartment would be nice? I thought they could have add an option to add 2 3v cell batteries or a small lipo just to eliminate the wires. I still like using the micro USB for a power option, it just would be nice to have an internal power supply.<br /><br />That's all I got to say that's negative. It's really light and compact which is great.",2015-03-25

I think so.  one reviewer said they were bulky, this is true, however they are light and you don't look at yourself while listening to music anyway.  I plan to use when walking and just returned from a test walk.  Worked find.I could listen to program and was aware of all the sounds around me at the same time.  Now about why I gave it 5 stars.  The sound quality.  It is unlike any headphone or ear bud I have used.  The sound is perfect.  I listened to some viola solo work.  The sound is exactly what I hear when I have a viola under my chin.  Wow.  I am not as good as the performer on the CD,  however the resonance and tone are precisely the same.

It worked great for maybe 2 months.  The sound is fantastic.  Great bass and treble.  But then they stopped charging, and my pc wouldn't recognize the device.  Apparently, this was a known problem with Sony because I dug out my paperwork and found a special insert describing how to clean the charging contacts on the headphones.  After about 3 cleanings with a toothbrush, they finally started working again.  Great!  But wait...another 2 months later, same thing.  Another 4 attempts at cleaning, and they worked again.

Rather stick with real bookshelf speakers.,"UPDATE: Used for a couple weeks, still an OK speaker for a small room. But none of these cheap bluetooth speakers can compare to even a cheap set of powered stereo bookshelf speakers. If you want that kind of sound you need to move way up to bluetooth Sonos or Bose, at $250+.  If you are using these inside a house, really how portable do they have to be?  The novelty has worn off, I am back to using powered/wired Bose full range speakers, I bought at BJs club for $69.  Old review: Just Received. Sound is good. Clear mid/treble. Some bass, depending on the song. ( sampling iTune purchases of 70s-80s rock)  I am using iPod Nano. Connecting with Bluetooth. From one album song to the next sound varies quite a bit. Nano has EQ settings, and I am still looking for one that will fit most songs. Best, so far, is to turn up source (nano) all the way, then adjust volume on the speaker. I listened to the Bose Mini at Target, loud with plenty of deep end, moderate mids or treble, for $199. Oontz Plus is $49, with good mid/treble and some base. UPDATE: I am trying the speaker turned around, base port facing out, speakers to the back, reflecting off of a polished marble floor tile. That shouldn't work because it will degrade the the mids/treble right? Not so much, Sounds good, maybe because it is very clear to start with. Now there is a noticeable base improvement.",2015-01-08

On weak signals on any band, there is a strong hiss that can't be eliminated by the 3 position tone control. It does *not* have RDS on FM to show station ID, song title, & artist, even though most stations in metro areas are offering this. There is no longwave, VHF air, weather, single sideband or synchronous detection. FM sensitivity to weak signals is worse than some under $100 portables, as is medium wave (AM BCB). It does sound pretty good on  most medium to strong signals, with somewhat more volume available. FM wide/narrow is a gimmick, as it is still less selective on FM than most DSP radios with only 1 FM selectivity.<br /><br />Sangean chose to not provide an external antenna jack for any band, though you could clip a short wire to telescoping antenna for shortwave, using an alligator clip. Shortwave signals are often very weak, so a wire clipped onto telescoping antenna is often needed.<br /><br />To get to some functions, one must press 2-3 buttons in order.

The screws that came with the mount for attaching to the wall were 100% perfect for attaching to a stud.  Which raises the point addressed in other reviews, where I will ask: WHY IN YOUR RIGHT MIND WOULD YOU INSTALL A FLAT SCREEN TV, WEIGHING DOWN A HORIZONTAL TV MOUNT, ADDING SHEARING GRAVITATIONAL FORCE TO THE EQUATION, *ONLY* TO DRYWALL!?!? If you're installing a TV wall mount - *ANY* TV wall mount - install it in a stud. They're only 18&#34; apart and these types of TV mounts will easily span that difference in adjustability. There is just no logical reason whatsoever to use drywall alone. DRILL IN TO A STUD, PEOPLE!  It did take a while for me to install, probably about 2 hours - but that was complicated because I didn't notice that the mount could be adjusted for horizontal tilt just by adjusting the top two TV screws, and I kept trying to get the mount centered on the wall. Lesson learned for your advantage: the mount does NOT need to be perfectly level on the wall when you screw it in. There is probably about 5, maybe 10 degrees of adjustment built in to the part where the TV is attached to the mount, by loosening the top two bolt heads, lining the TV up, and tightening them back down.  Because it was my fault for not noticing that adjustability, I can't subtract any points from the unit review. User error all the way. Once I got it tightened down (by the way, I used a shim between the mount and the wall to introduce about a 10 degree downward angle, so the TV is easier to see from our bed - it worked perfectly!), this unit lived up to well beyond what we paid for it.  Short story: 100% recommended.",2015-08-29

The TV is 84lbs.  Its an older TV so its not that thin and I was concerned that the mount being flush would not work because we are placing it in a recessed spot on the wall.  After several attempts the TV would not fit because it was just a hair to thick for the recessed area.  The mount is low profile and worked like a charm on flat walls, however with the TV we had I had to purchase two 1x3's to extend this low profile mount to fit our needs.  It was nice that it came with a long HDMI cable and bubble level.  It even came with a small little flashlight which came in handy to view the ports behind the TV once mounted to the wall.<br /><br />For the price this mount can't be beat.  I looked at mounts a major electronics store as well as a big box retailer and the mounts there were 80.00 and up.  This mount can't be beat for the price!  We put it into the studs by the way so I did not use the drywall mounts.<br /><br />The only con was that the box was small so you have to put two pieces together to make one long piece of the mount.  Other than that it was a great mount.  The TV we put up was 84lbs and a 50&#34;.  Also the tv was a good 4-5&#34; thick.<br /><br />I will update this review if the TV falls off.:)",2015-04-27

Certainty this can't be all of them?  Other reviewers have said you can take it apart and disconnect the display to eliminate noise but that's hardly acceptable.  I love the Lepai LP-2020 ($20) although wanted a remote.  I think this is a Class A/B amp without the fidelity of the Tripath chip.  Also have a SMSL SA-50 Class D amp with excellent sound so it's not just the Tripath but this was a disappointment.  I have an appreciation for these toys and have ordered the Lepai LP-2020USB and LP-V9S which both have remote but no bypass around treble/bass.  The 2020 sounds best straight through.  Really quite good.  Four speakers could also be hooked since the LP-269FS isn't 4 channel anyway.  Really hoping for good sound from these two or may have to spend more for a Grace or Teac which also make Class D amps with reported high quality (but problems of their own).  The sound quality from the Tripath or other high quality Class B amps may surprise you in a very good way.  I've enjoyed them very much.,2015-01-13

Both of them had an issue where it would lose signal to the video/audio for a second or two. It's random. There's not a way to tell when it's going to happen. I'm a gamer and it sucks playing online and having the video cut out for a couple of seconds.<br /><br />The other thing is that when you power it on/off, it might cause your speakers to make a loud popping sound if you don't give it enough time to power down first. I'm certain it's eventually going to damage my speakers. It's rare that you're going to turn it off then back on, but be warned if you do.<br /><br />Outside of these two things, the unit is great and looks really nice. While it might not sound like enough to justify a 3-star, it is. The annoying way it turns off/on randomly, sometimes multiple times an hour, just takes away from an otherwise beautiful sounding receiver.",2015-05-04

It is so hard to find this feature especially in an over the ear style at a reasonable price. If a reviewer says it isn't loud enough, they need hearing aids (or they have it incorrectly connected to their system.) Personally,  I set it just above the low setting and it is perfect, and yes, I do have hearing issues. If I were to put it on high, I really would go deaf!! It really does go up very loud as well as very low and I fidget with it especially during movies when bombs are dropping or when people are talking very quietly. As far as fit,  I have a large head (really) and it fits snug but comfortably. The padding and shape are comfortable enough, I have felt better, but it is really difficult to find earphones with inline volume control, so I am happy. Personally, I don't need left and right volume control separated, but it is invaluable for those that do.  Final thought...a solid product and wonderful for those of us that require in-line volume control, especially if you need it louder in one ear than the other and want over the ear instead of ear-bud style. You should not be disappointed at all. Thanks! 11/2015 UPDATE: Should have posted this much sooner. I found a major flaw, for me. The crucial part of this for me was the volume control and it is permanently attached to the headphones so if you have a cat and it loves to chew through cables and it chews through this cable you have to throw the whole thing out...which is what I had to do. If it detached from the earpiece the company could offer replacement cords. Sucks, at least for a crasy cat owner! But, If you don't have a crazy cat, they are still great headphones!!!",2015-01-20

But the product has some strong design flaws.  First off, getting the disk to turn to buff more than a narrow strip required manually rotating the disk while cranking the handle, which meant a third hand was required just to keep the overall device stable.  If you turned the handle the wrong way, even briefly, by mistake, the disk would be shoved out of the machine.  (Less of an issue, ironically, if you're holding the disk to rotate it as per my first complaint).<br /><br />In it's favor, it did render an unusable disk usable again, albeit with a lot of grumbling and muttered oaths from the operator.",2015-01-30

The only thing that I had any trouble with was plugging in the audio - and it was not much of a problem at all. The plug went in, but it did not go completely in at the end.

It works like a $9 shortwave radio,"This is a hard product to review because a &#34;good&#34; shortwave radio costs 10x more than this one, and an excellent shortwave radio costs much more than that.  Frankly I didn't know a sub-ten-dollar shortwave radio was even possible until I found this on Amazon.  Because it had no reviews I didn't know what to think so I bought it.<br /><br />As expected for an under-ten-dollar-radio, it feels cheap and flimsy, but I was prepared to give it a chance.  The antenna does not telescope very far so it always remains very short.  The sound quality from the speaker is also what you expect in this price range.<br /><br />When I first tried every shortwave band, I couldn't bring in a single station.  There were a few spots while tuning that the static changed but nothing that resembled a real signal.  But to be honest I was somewhat expecting that because we have a metal roof.  I went outside and tried again, and this time I was able to pull in a station or two on each shortwave band- though the majority of them weren't good enough quality to discern what the station was or even what language it was in.<br /><br />I plan on tinkering with this more again later during different times of the day and night.  If you are looking for a quality shortwave radio, this is not the product for you.  If you are only willing to spend 8 or 9 dollars (and free shipping at that) then this product is better than having no shortwave radio at all.",2015-08-19

The headphones are AWESOME. I did extensive research and decided on these and I am sooooo glad I did. I am by no means an expert, but I have a lot of hands on experience with Bose and was sure that I was going to purchase the new QC 25's. I started looking and made a stop at several stores and tried their displays using my cell phone (Galaxy S4). I was honestly not at all impressed by the Bose product. In fact, based on my initial search hands on, it was between the Samsung Level Over or the Beats Studio product. I preferred the Samsung product because it was more comfortable.<br />So then I got online and started looking around and kept seeing the Audio Technica M50X come up. I read enough reviews that a few consistent one concerned me about the actual sound quality. I then started looking into the Sennheiser Momentum headphones and saw a comparison to these. Sennheiser had a great reputation and I read several review where the Viso HP50's were chosen over the Momentums. I then read several reviews where people actually owned both sets and chose the HP50's. The final deciding factor was several reviews by industry professionals that stated these were the best cans in this price range they had ever heard. While I am not in that class, I can say this: They are very nice looking and well built. They are very comfortable and have a nice case and they pack small which is important to me. The sound is OUT OF THIS WORLD AWESOME. I am listening to music and hearing things I never heard  in songs I have listened to for over 20 years. I am sold on these and I highly recommend them. They are definitely worth the $299 I paid for them.",2015-03-10

I work out 6 days a week with headphones and use headphones at work in a machine shop so I spend about 5-6 hours a day with headphones on. I have had these for a week and am finally so irritated with the poor design that I had to come write a review. The single issue that has me ready to throw them in the trash is that they are designed so that the two ear pieces are exactly parallel to each other. I have never seen a human being with a square head, and even if you did have a square head your EARS are only on the anterior (rear) side of your ear canal so they would no longer be parallel anyways. Basically after having these on for an hour my ears are on fire with pain because the pressure is localized ONLY on the ear and not in front of the ear canal at all. Most overear head phones can pivot at least a few degrees (its a standard feature), wrap around headphones ALL have a natural curve that matches the shape of the head, but these have NO WAY to adjust them to actually match the shape of any humans head. I am 5' 10&#34; (average) and have normal sized ears and am usually spoiled by having everything fit me since I am the &#34;average male&#34; size and build, but these are absolutely unbearably painful. How they have maintained a 4 star rank on here is completely beyond me. I can only guess that because of the entry level price the reviews are primarily people who are so excited by the bluetooth or folding feature that they haven't noticed these are the most uncomfortable headphones on the planet. I understand giving a high rank for cheaper items, but ONLY if they have the features found on every single pair (at least 20) of over ear headphones I have had since the early 80's.<br /><br />THE SOUND:<br />These definitely have some pretty rocking bass and give a great sound in quiet environments. The cool looking slits on the back of the speaker housing created a terrible whistling from wind when I wore these the other night walking my dog as well. In addition to making them unusable in the wind it also allows in a LOT of outside noise. For me that isn't a problem since I wear earplugs inside my over ear headphones at work... protects the ears from loud machines and I can still hear them over the music, but if you want any noise canceling while wearing your headphones these are NOT going to make you a happy camper.<br /><br />The controls:<br />Very intuitive controls. Better than any other headset I currently own actually and the adorable voice that says &#34;Devise connected&#34; and &#34;Power On&#34; should be used for voice guidance as it is very nice and much better than the normal &#34;BEEEEEEEEP&#34; of most other headphones to tell you the same thing.<br /><br />Personally I would STRONGLY recommend the Photive BTH3 Bluetooth 4.0 Headphones for about the same price. They fold FLAT not into a large clunky wad of headphone, and come with a case.<br /><br />All in all these are the single worst bluetooth headphones I have purchased. I have Beats, Photive, and a few others I have destroyed over the last few years. I do NOT expect high quality from a $35 headset, but I do expect standard features found on most others for the same price.

These are actually to me, a much better option. They are not quiet as strong as normal cable ties, but they come really close and work well for everything you need to do other than possibly placing one on something to ensure it does not get opened ( which could still easily be opened with a normal cable tie as well and just replaced ) .<br /><br />I have found that these are really good  for my tools also to use to hang them on the hooks in my garage and in my shop. You can place the cable tie around the tool and then secure it to an enclosed round or square hook and the tool will hand perfectly, even the heavier tools so far I have not had any issues hanging on with these. These work well for winding up my large electrical cords and keeping them tucked on the cord reels, the Velcro cable ties are the  perfect solution to that problem I have had for years now.<br /><br />These are really much heavier duty than you would expect, I tried pretty hard to try to break one or even get it to open , and no luck, and I am not a weakling either. The colors are easier too because I can keep things more organized and when I need something just tell my wife what color tie is around it or on it, and I have a much better shot of actually  getting the right tool I need.<br /><br />These seem to be made of heavy duty materials , the Velcro holds very well, these work just as well if not better in some cases, than normal cable ties and overall I have to say 5 stars.<br /><br />I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",2015-08-25

My TV remote only has a single on/off button, and a single button to cycle the inputs, which the Harmony handled well.  Set up was smooth, only took around 20 minutes, and paired easily with a Roku and a WiiU.<br /><br />When it worked, everything worked easily, and was straightforward.  There are some tasks that can only be accomplished with the app, not the included physical remote.  If that's a problem, you'll want to spring for the pricier Harmony One.  I was fine with that limitation, as I just wanted a physical remote for guests, or when I didn't have a phone handy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, throughout the month of use, we've had fairly consistent wifi issues.  This is a major problem, since the hub (and your media center) are effectively unresponsive when it can't communicate via wifi.  After working through as much troubleshooting on our end as possible, we searched the logitech forums and found a huge community that was experiencing the same issues.<br /><br />I love the product, but I'll be sending this back and waiting for the next version.",2015-01-25

We have a game room with the need to run many devices. We have a satellite box, DVD player and 4 different gamming systems that are plugged into 2 different TV's and 3 teenagers. It is very helpful to have all the devices pluged in and ready to go so that all you have to do is turn on the TV and pick which device you want by pushing the coresponding button. This is so much easier than having to find the right plugs to plug in each time you want to switch devices. Having 2 TV's with the ability to switch devices quickly keeps the kids entertained and they never fight over whose turn it is to play a video game. They can sit side by side and play 2 different games or they can watch TV or get on YouTube while someone else is playing a game. We love the ease of switching devices so quickly and have had no problems with this device. I highly recommend this to anyone who uses more devices than they have plugs in the TV.

Charging was as simple as connecting one end of the USB to the speaker and the other end to my computer. The unit charged surprisingly quickly. Once charged I paired the speaker easily with both my iPhone and my iPad. Once paired, the speaker was ready to use. The HD sound quality is impeccable! This baby packs quite a sound punch!  The sound is surprisingly loud and clear for such a small speaker. There is no small tinny sound with this speaker. You will be pleasantly surprised. The Bluetooth signal remained strong as I traveled from room to room in my house.  The range was strong as long as there were no closed doors or multiple walls to interfere with the signal.

I got it to transfer music files between four musicians in my band. These mp3 players are so low priced I could easily buy four, one for each band member.<br /><br />I'm using it with a new MacPro Cylinder I bought here on Amazon. There was no problem seeing the mp3 player on the desktop, it shows up as noname, I left the default name. I threw away the Chinese mp3 music file that came installed.<br /><br />The player would not work with any m4a files from iTunes. I used a freeware converter to change all files installed into mp3 format and every song plays. I found that I could group songs in folders, I kept folder names to 8 characters or less. Folders play alphabetically after you turn the unit on. So far I have not found a way to control order of playback from inside a folder.<br /><br />I did not try to play video or anything other than audio. The ear buds that come with the unit are the typical thin-no-bass sounding variety but they are included in the $13 purchase price. You also get a USB cable that looks like the old 30 pin iPod style but I doubt that it is.<br /><br />It is obviously styled to look like an Apple iPod, don't be confused, it's not close, but it is functional and workable. It is nice to have the display for navigating, it is bright and easy to read, even for me (and I'm blind in my right eye from a cataract). The &#34;WheeL&#34; on the front does not scroll by sliding your finger around it, instead, you navigate by using the left and right arrows to go up and down through the menus, when you're on the one you want you press &#34;menu&#34; and it takes you in another layer. I navigate into the music menu and the music player automatically starts up. Again the display is nice because it shows you the sample rate of one track, the file name, the folder name and a little RTA display of the frequency response when the file is playing. You can pause, skip to the next song and go back to the previous song using the buttons on the wheel.<br /><br />If you press the center button while a music file is playing it gives you the volume control menu, press arrow left for lower and arrow right for louder, menu to go back to music player display. The display will time out and go dark to save battery after a minute or so of no button pushes.<br /><br />The stock ear buds did not sound very good so I plugged in a $150 pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50, moderately high-end studio headphones. Wow, I was surprised, very surprised how loud this little music player could drive the AT headphones, most impressive.<br /><br />When playing audio files, sometimes the beginning of the audio files is clipped off. We're listening to original studio recordings so we're sure of the quality of the source files.<br /><br />The player also functions fine as an 8GB portable hard drive which is exactly what I like to think of it as, a jump drive with a video screen and a simple mp3 player thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />AUDIO QUALITY OF THE PLAYER: Except for the glitch at the beginning of song files the frequency response of the player is surprisingly good, I connected it with a patch cord and drove my Meyer HD monitors. The sound quality was easily as good as any Motu converter I've heard, not quite as clear as my Apogee Ensemble or Behringer X32.<br /><br />I liked the first one (our test unit) so much I just ordered three more of these players. It is very handy to be able to play the audio files right off the portable disk drive.<br /><br />If you're after it to be a really high quality player this is probably not the right one to get. Personally I'd spend more and get the real Apple iPod (my GF and I have three between us). But this player is so cheap if the band members loose them or never give them back, no big deal, and it's easy to transfer the files off the player onto a computer and play them there without glitches at the beginning.<br /><br />Another thing I like about these cheap little mp3 players is that you do not need to use the iTunes software to transfer files to and from the unit, when you're connected to the pc you are looking at the root directory of the unit, it's easy to drag files in and out, even rename them on the drive.<br /><br />This is another of those strange and weird things that you only find on Amazon, I bought it PRIME and know Amazon will take care of me if the thing dies a quick death. So far so good, I will post more after I receive the next three players.<br /><br />BTW It could have been five star but the directions provided were not even for the player I received. The buttons were labeled differently and the USB cable connects with an odd connector to the unit. I dinged them a star for the directions and the player glitching at the beginning of songs and cutting off a hair. This is a player you can lose and not be too sad about it (oops I drove the lawnmower over it).<br /><br />Good luck and good music to all!, no big deal, and it's easy to transfer the files off the player onto a computer and play them there without glitches at the beginning.<br /><br />Another thing I like about these cheap little mp3 players is that you do not need to use the iTunes software to transfer files to and from the unit, when you're connected to the pc you are looking at the root directory of the unit, it's easy to drag files in and out, even rename them on the drive.<br /><br />This is another of those strange and weird things that you only find on Amazon, I bought it PRIME and know Amazon will take care of me if the thing dies a quick death.

(except for Win, Power, More/Info buttons). I do not use WMC, I've bought it for KODI in Win7. Most buttons work without any tinkering. However there's no button for context menu (c) so you'll have to find a work around. Without going into any register key fuss I opt to install  MCERemote add-on and mapped more/info button  for the task.<br /><br />Since in my particular set up I don't need WMC I also wanted to use green Win button for starting KODI. (Out of box it starts WMC) One can easily set it by right clicking KODI shortcut and from properties assigning it a short cut key. Then map those key to green button with MCERemote.<br /><br />The last small glitch is arranging an exit button. You can simply find the keymaps file in KODI (C:\Program Files (x86)\XBMC\system\keymaps  for Win7) and copy it to %appdata%\Roaming\XBMC\userdata\keymaps. Then edit the file for producing a Quit shortcut key. For example ctrl+s is the default shortcut for taking screenshots. Replace it like that:<br />change &#60;s mod=&#34;ctrl&#34;&#62;Screenshot&#60;/s&#62;<br />to this line:<br />&#60;s mod=&#34;ctrl&#34;&#62;Kodi.Quit&#60;/s&#62;<br />Then again map it to some button via MCERemote. (I've mapped it to Power button)<br />Voilà !!! Now you have a tailor made remote for KODI. Works like as charm.<br /><br />Only downside for me is the built of the remote. It is flimsy and small so the buttons are a little bit tiny for my choice. But  again that is a trivial issue. All in all excellent remote for the price.",2015-08-12

After a cursory look at the instructions, the installation was even easier than anticipated. My application is for rear surround speakers: I hooked up the 1600 transmitter to the rear-surround audio-out (RCA jacks) on my AVR, connected the rear speakers to each clearly marked right/left receiver with the supplied wires (in the box!), and the surround came to life with no further involvement from me. On this last point, the kit contains everything you need to be up and running in minutes, no need to run to the audio store for missing bits.<br /><br />Power output is more than sufficient for surround, which is my given my application. I haven’t tried any other configuration so I can’t speak to those.<br /><br />A nice feature of the 1600 must be noted: the unit goes into standby when the AVR is off or muted for a while. I can hear a slight pop as the 1600 receivers come back online when the AVR output channels power back on. I find this reassuring since power coming back on, is, well… power coming back on!<br /><br />A word on transmission: my application is line of sight, I have other wireless gear, yet I hear no interference from anything anywhere, hence the inspired choice of a 5.8 Ghz transmitter freq, (my phones at 6, my network at 2.4)<br /><br />A hiccup: I ran the automatic surround setup on the AVR and everything balanced itself out perfectly (this last part took beyond the original 15 minutes btw). However, the auto-surround setup on the AVR reported crossed wires/phase on one of the rear speakers. I checked the wires then simply bypassed the error as suggested and was good to go. I couldn’t tell that there was any sound difference with the previously wired speaker. It could be a freak of my auto-surround detection seeing as my room is nowhere near acoustically perfect, by any means, but thought it worth a mention here for transparency’s sake.<br /><br />General warning: ***VERY important*** plug the DC current (the round power plug) into the units BEFORE plugging the transformer into the AC wall outlet, otherwise you get a dirty great arc as you approach the connector to DC-in, especially to the receiver units…scary… you have been warned! To be fair, this was clearly highlighted, but I was tired, it was late, and got caught on the last hookup.<br /><br />Overall, I’m very satisfied with the performance and ease of operation wich is a huge factor for my significant other and I. In fact we forget it’s even there, which is precisely what this was all about.",2015-06-11

47618784,R1CP2ZM129WHY9,B012MFY696,818813411,NEW! moto hint + 2nd generation bluetooth headset moto hint plus -dark fabric,Electronics,4,17,19,N,N,Finally...the Sweet Spot Between Steath and Battery Life,"A few months ago, my chiropractor was wearing the 1st gen and I didn't notice it until he pointed it out. I was jealous, but then I saw the mixed reviews, and I backed off from getting it.<br /><br />Based on positive early reviews, I bought 2nd generation Moto Hint from a well-known national consumer electronics store. My first impression is that it's really the quintessential stealthy Bluetooth headset that most people will not notice you're wearing.<br /><br />(UPDATE 8/7/2015: Speaking of \\""hints,\\"", there is quite a variance of price points you'll find for the new version of the Moto Hint. Be a smart shopper :-)<br /><br />While the talk time is rated at 4 hours, I'm leaning toward keeping it because it seems to be a REAL 4 hours, unlike what I perceived to be the [[ASIN:B00H2RP7BQ Jawbone ERA's imaginary 4 hours which seemed to be more like 2.5 to 3.]] While I do use these headsets for calls, I do also stream books and other audio a lot, so I may be willing to put up with the Hint given all it's other positives.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Report Card for 2nd Gen Moto Hint<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Getting Up and Running: A-<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />❖ You get a case, 3 different sized ear gels, and a micro-USB charging cable. I was glad that it was a not proprietary cable since I have a myriad of these cables all over the house. Charging it for the first time was intuitive. You slide the drawer out, insert the Hint, and slide it back it in. With the case plugged in via the micro-USB, you're in business two hours later.<br /><br />❖ CAUTION: The Hint can ONLY be charged using the case. You lose the case...you have to buy another.<br /><br />Fit and Comfort: B+<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />❖ This was one of my biggest concerns. But fortunately, it stays in my ear and I really don't have any fear that it'll drop out without my knowing. But that also ties in with a disadvantage.<br /><br />❖ CAUTION: It substantially blocks the hearing of whichever ear you put it in. While it has a setting that allows external sounds to flow though, that burns extra battery from it's already meager battery life.<br /><br />Ease of Use: B+<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />❖ It's really a marvel of cutting edge technology packed into a tiny case not much bigger than the tip of your thumb.<br /><br />When you have it in your ear, it accepts calls. But you take it out of your ear, the calls will be taken on your phone.<br /><br />Instead instead of a conventional button, it's one that you simply tap. But taping a certain number of times or or holding, you are able to call up different functions. For example, if you hold for second or two and you get Siri. If you hold for eight seconds, it takes you through the settings menu. One thing that was a little annoying is that I was not able to call up the setting menu consistently using the 8 second press. The good news is that you won't have to access it very often.<br /><br />Calls and Sound Quality: B+<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />❖ Making and receiving calls was a smooth and easy process. You can say \\""answer\\"" or \\""ignore\\"" to accept or reject calls.<br /><br />❖ It needs a bit of fine tuning because at the lowest volume setting, it seems a little louder than it should be. But other than that, its pretty crisp and clear. Not quite to the level of my [[ASIN:B00P8A2J4W 2 Plantronics Voyager Legends]], but still very satisfying.<br /><br />Degree of Stealth: A+<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />❖ This really the one I'd want to wear to social gatheringsor just going around town on weekends. I don't feel one bit self-conscious wearing it.<br /><br />Battery Life: C+<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />❖ This is the one Bluetooth headset I've tried in which the disadvantage of shorter battery life is more of than offset by the other advantages mentioned above. What's important to note is that, unlike the Jawbone ERA, I feel like I am getting a full 4-hours. I streamed music for roughly and hour and half and the battery life indicator had moved in proportion to that usage.  Of course, if you're not streaming audio, that extends your battery life to more like 10 or 11 hours.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I'm in With the 2nd Gen Moto Hint<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Bigger picture, I think this is a keeper. My two biggest concerns are battery life and the way it blocks your hearing in one ear. But at the end of the day, the good outweighs the bad.----------------------------  ❖ This is the one Bluetooth headset I've tried in which the disadvantage of shorter battery life is more of than offset by the other advantages mentioned above.

45377850,RHYU7L9U2IW6O,B00D5Q75RC,945049581,Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,0,0,N,N,I was concerned the bose would not sound $170 better. Well,"Not sure it is necessary to write a detialed review as there are about 4,000 of them already.  I will cover concerns I had before buying.  My previous portable speaker is a JAM Classic speaker that cost about $30 - for reference. I do like the sound of that speaker - for $30 amazing as well but I wanted more.  1. I was concerned the bose would not sound $170 better.  Well, I am not sure it does but it sounds much much more full and rich.  2. One of the reasons I was interested in the Bose was the charging cradle. I hated when my HMDX went dead in the middle of using it. Ther Bose is always charged up. I would never run it for more then 3-4 hours at a time and in doing so, I have never had an issue. No USB cables to deal with - super convenient. I am very satisfied with this aspect of the speaker.  3. Bass - MIxed feelings here. If I have it in a corner or directly against a wall - there is too much base. Even 3-5&#34; makes a difference. No huge deal, just be aware of it, and move it.  You can find different locations where it will work for sure.  4. Weight - much heavier than I expected. I saw one guy in his review get ripped for calling it a &#34;brick&#34;. Well guess right - he is spot on - it feels like a light brick.  5. Portability - I did not buy the travel case or soft cover. With that said, I would not use this for travel as is. It is heavy and solid. But if it gets banged or dropped, my opinion is it would get damaged or damage the floor. I did not buy it for these reasosn those. Honestly if you used this in a hotel room you would get complaints. The bass is deep and the sound it full.  GZood for you or bad for you, this speaker easily fills a small room with big sound.  6. Depth - I an more of a Polk fan and have never owned a Bose speaker before. I do like the sound. The seperation on the bass and higher freq is unique to bose. It sounds like it is 2d or 3d sound. The negative is the Bose can sound artificial at times. I am listening to Bjork right nowand it sounds amazing.  7. Bluetooth - zero issues using it with my iPhone 5S. Works great. I do however typically use an AUX in cable when using. My preference for battery life and audio quality. Already give up so much going to MP3, using Bluetooth dilutes it even more.  Hmmm - I feel like that covers it expcet was it worth $200?  My summary: 1. For what I wanted it for, a mainly home speaker that I could move around the house, garage, outdoors, absolutely yes! 2. Sound = For the size incredible sound, just beware of placement and bass impact. 3. Portable - If I did want to take this somewhere often I would buy the travel case and bumper cover. I think it is needed, but is another $70 combined. Huge negative for me.  Hope this helps.",2015-03-08

It's true there is a very slight hiss when the noise cancelling is turned on, but this effectively disappears in all but the very quietest classical music. They are especially good at eliminating the drone of jet engines - doing wildly better than the noise cancelling over-ear headphones which Delta provided me in their Business class.<br /><br />Sound quality: I feel the sound is excellent - the bass is rich and powerful, but only when it should be - they're not as boomy as a lot of bass-heavy buds. The mids and treble are well-balanced and pleasing.<br /><br />Battery Life: I'm extremely happy with the battery life - I've yet to use it for more than maybe 8 straight hours without recharging, but within that 8 hours I never hit the low battery warning.<br /><br />Comfort: I've got sensitive ears and tend to have a hard time finding earbuds which fit well and are comfortable, but as soon as I switched to the larger tips I found that these fit perfectly and were comfortable enough to wear for (very) extended periods. I'd go so far as to say these are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever used.<br /><br />Size: If I've got one problem with this product, it's that everything about it is significantly larger than any set of earbuds I've used. The earpieces themselves are big, the cables are thick, and the inline processing unit adds significant bulk if you need to pocket it and makes it awkward to pull your phone or music player back out of your pocket. If you store them in the included pouch it's pretty bulky in a front pants pocket.<br /><br />Overall, I was pretty nervous ordering a $250 pair of headphones, but I've got no regrets so far. I'd certainly recommend them.",2015-06-16

On the inside you get the typical &#34;Welcome to the cult of Razer&#34; letter, instructions and stickers that you get with all of their products nice an snug between cardboard packaging making it simple to pull everything out even if you're left with a lot of crap to through out but oh well. The soundbar is also in a cloth pouch which is nice I suppose. A+ here Razer.<br /><br />Setting it up couldn't be easier, all cables run to the soundbar with a single cable running from the subwoofer which is nice if you like keeping your set-up looking cable free and clean. All cables you'd possibly need are included as well, so you don't have to worry about picking up an Optical Cable or anything. You're also given two sets of feet for the soundbar so you can raise and angle it however you please for your aesthetic or aural preferences. Once you're done plugging it all in, hit the power button and you're ready to rock.<br /><br />I currently have the soundbar acting as a speaker for my PC (via 3.5 jack) and to replace the aging, terrible speakers on my TV (via Optical) which have begun to rattle. Oh, I also have my phone hooked up via Bluetooth but more on that later. The sound, is awesome. These sound better than my previous speakers and they can get ear-harmingly loud if that's your thing and you won't hear any rattling or peaking. The subwoofer booms and is perfect for games and movies. Sadly, there's no EQ, instead you get a button that'll toggle between 3 different modes: game, music and movies each being represented by a green icon that glows when you switch between them. So if you want further EQ control you'll be doing that software-side. All buttons are hidden behind bar except for the power button so it keeps the look simple though it can make it a little annoying adjust volume, change the EQ presets and whatnot.<br /><br />As for getting your phone hooked up via Bluetooth, it couldn't be easier, just tap your phone on the Leviathan (if you have NFC on your phone) and you'll be prompted to connect on your phone. Once you connect the Leviathan will automatically switch itself into Bluetooth mode and you're good to go. Also, if you switch the Leviathan to AUX or Optical it'll turn off the Bluetooth and disconnect from your phone but switching back automatically pairs it up. Very simple and easy to use.<br /><br />My only complaint is the device will shut off by itself after 10 or 15 minutes if there is no sound going to it, whichch would seem like a nice feature but if you're just doing some browsing online that time goes by quick. I find myself turning it back on more often than I'd like. It's really dumb and I have no idea why they included this or didn't give an option to disable it.<br /><br />Over all I'd definitely recommend the Razer Leviathan, I wouldn't doubt if you can find a product that sounds equally as good for less of a price but you will be getting a good product with fantastic sound.ar except for the power button so it keeps the look simple though it can make it a little annoying adjust volume, change the EQ presets and whatnot.

We traveled together a few weeks ago on a bus from New York City to Atlanta; I listened to the radio in every state. Reception wasn't always great but I got to know this radio's quirks well. I plugged a 1/8&#34; cable into the headphone jack and recorded snippets of the radio using my Zoom H5 recorder.<br /><br />I recently disassembled this radio, built it a new case, and went to Washington Square Park to convince people that this radio wasn't just a radio, but a &#34;radio instrument&#34;. I &#34;played&#34; it by moving it and adjusting the antenna and other controls. I encouraged people to wave it around and experience the glitchiness of this radio (static, fading between stations, etc).<br /><br />Here is a transcript of one conversation I had about this radio:<br /><br />&#34;Hi - would you like to try out my radio instrument?&#34;<br />  &#34;Of course I would, tell me about it.&#34;<br />&#34;It's like a radio, but it's an instrument. And so, you can hear it's kind of, like, analog, it fades between stations a little bit.&#34;<br />  &#34;Oh yeah, yeah!&#34;<br />&#34;It's just supposed to be my favorite parts of radio--<br />  &#34;This is your favorite parts of radio?&#34;<br />&#34;Lots of weird static, and yeah, fun stuff like that... I like that the radio is an object, and I feel like we've lost touch with that.&#34;<br />  &#34;Interesting.&#34;<br />&#34;It's fun to play with the radio. I'm receiving stations and then adding some extra static, or noise&#34;  (not true, this was just a normal radio)<br />  &#34;This is something you built?&#34;<br />&#34;Yeah, I built the case, the parts are from other radios and stuff that i found&#34;  (this isn't entirely true, the internal radio components were not changed)<br />  &#34;Ha - there's a radio station!&#34; (radio station comes through static)<br />&#34;Yeah, sometimes you get weird stuff--&#34;<br />  &#34;This is so cool!&#34;<br />&#34;--if you're in a certain position-- really??&#34;<br />  &#34;Yeah... this is the coolest thing in the world! This is so fun! It's like an ocean... all around us&#34; (referring to the static)<br />&#34;Yeah, that's kind of what's interesting about old technologies, though, I think... is their analog charm&#34;<br />  &#34;Yeah, it's very charming... well, thanks!&#34;ally??&#34;<br />  &#34;Yeah... this is the coolest thing in the world!

And even though there are recording apps, I needed a dedicated voice recorder for work. I had been using my 15 year old Olympus DS-2 digital recorder, but needed something that could scroll through files easier and quickly. The VRS works just fine. I am able to take memos and scroll through them easily. The audio feedback when I press a button is wonderful. I am able to quickly scroll and time jump in my memos. I find the recorder works best for taking memos or interviews within 6 feet. I was very disappointed with the mic and audio recording level in a larger room or conference room. The audio level was lower than desired for an expensive voice recorder. In these situations, I still use my Olympus digital recorder, which has far superior abilities for recording in larger rooms.<br />I have not utilized the media features much. I find these features to be easier on my smart phone. I did put my meditation mp3 on the VRS and it was easy to find. I also scrolled through the internet radio stations and found some good stations. I do plan to utilize the BARD talking books in the future. The wireless capability is great for updates, internet radio, and downloading digital books. There is a learning curb to using this device, but it is no more difficult than learning to use a new Smartphone.<br />Features to improve:<br />1. Better audio recording for larger rooms and venues. I don’t know if this requires a better mic or improved firmware. My Olympus DS-2 has dedicated settings for dictation (recording nearby) or conference (larger venues) and it is over 15 years old. You can find many less expensive digital voice recorders that have better recording quality, but they do not have the audio feedback necessary for people with visual impairments.<br />2. The ability to make folders in notes. I find myself scrolling through the 295 memos to find specific files. It is difficult to memorize file numbers when constantly adding and deleting files. If I could separate files into folders it would be nice. A $20 voice recorder has this ability—why can’t this expensive recorder do the same?<br />3.",2015-01-24

I would have given it 5 stars, but for me the fit was way tighter than my old (cheaper) cable, to the point of being almost impossible to insert into the computer without some delicate forcefulness (oxymoron?).  I had to insert one end at a slight angle, and put some pressure to nudge the female jack on the computer into allowing me to insert the male cable. It was so tight, it seemed dicey, and I almost abandoned ship for fear of breaking something.  It appears that the thickness of the metal housing, and the fact the all of the columns and rows of pins are present and accounted for, but not needed, (compared to the old, cheaper cable, where two columns are left vacant) causes a much tighter fit. The gap tolerance around the female portion of the laptop is very tight.  If you are purchasing this as a cable you'll be removing and reinstalling frequently into a unit with tight tolerances (such as a laptop) I'd look elsewhere.  Otherwise I think you’ll risk possibly damaging the pins, or the computer's DVI jack, every time it's installed. The HDMI side did fit perfectly, and snugly, into the monitor.  I supposed the fact that it all fits so tightly could be construed as a good thing if you're looking for the best possible connection and stability.  Otherwise, really love the cable thickness, overall design/aesthetics, materials, and build quality. Overall, a winning cable with the fitment caveats mentioned.",2015-08-07

As soon as I tried the Inspiration on, I knew that was the headphone I wanted. They fit naturally and I loved the sleek style of them, but before I spent the $350 on them at my local retailer, I wanted to hear more about them to see if there were any manufacturer faults - I didn't find any, or at least none that qualified as a fault to me - and when I saw the price here (I purchased them when they were at $120), I didn't hesitate.<br /><br />I have had them now for about five or six months and they're still holding up great and have become my default headphones for whenever I am trying to just zone out and get stuff done.

27164332,R2JVKIYVAEDUBN,B004C04Q1S,702944391,Boston Acoustics Soundware XS 2.1 Home Stereo Speaker System,Electronics,2,0,3,N,Y,"My review of the Soundware 4 1/2"" speakers pretty much sums up this review here other than  these are ...","My review of the Soundware 4 1/2&#34; speakers pretty much sums up this review except that these are the surround speakers in a 4.1 for now system. They hold the volume very well and the subwoofer will shake your walls. I love the simple look of the sub's rounded edges with no speaker or ports showing. The 2 1/2&#34; speakers have a solid feel and weight for the size and put out much more than you might expect from something this small. I could hear no distortion at a volume that was scaring the animals and shaking windows and more than I will ever use. For the price this is on sale for it is a very good deal. I plan to add two Pearl White Orb's as the center speakers to give a little different sound and the round shape should look cool on either side of the receiver as well. Other than the Sub's size everything could and will be transported in one large suitcase. I also found the perfect rolling case for the Sub here on Amazon. It's the SKB small rolling powered mixer case for about $90.00 and should protect it from baggage handlers. Being a Musician for 50 years I have to be prepared to be transient and plan to take this system back to Hawai'i soon.  I'll update this after having time with it but for now I don't see a more powerful and compact a system other than the Orb which is more money and does not offer 4 1/2&#34; speakers which I believe give a larger sound than is capable by a 2 1/2&#34; or 3&#34; in the Orb's case can do. So the smart thing IMO was to combine this great 2.1 system with the Soundware 4 1/2&#34; speakers and eventually the Orb's for my last stereo.  BTW, I love Klipsch also and just purchased two KMC1's and a KMC3 for my offspring since they both won Bluetooth Speaker of the year in their respective portable Bluetooth Stereo Speaker category for 2014. They also sell for less than Bose.  Basically I just appreciate great sound combined with futuristic styling and good craftsmanship plus being as user friendly as possible. I believe all theseproducts meet these requirements. UPDATE: 5-24-15; I worked with this system this morning and I've come to the conclusion that this combination along with the Orb MOD1X twin pack cannot be beat for around $1000.00 plus the fact it all fits in two rolling bags with room to spare if need be. I feel total confidence in adding the Orb's from all the 5 star reviews I've read along with YouTube, and you should about purchasing any of the Soundware speakers or the best selling receiver here on Amazon. I can hardly wait to add the Orb's and complete the system. UPDATE: 5-25-15; &#34;BE AWARE&#34; that the Sub will turn off during periods of only dialog and back on when it detects music or bass notes. I find this a bit annoying at low volume's and wish there was a way to turn off this function. I do appreciate the power saving part so I won't deduct as long as this doesn't cause a problem in time.   As you can tell I was planning to add Orb's as center speakers but I was on their website last night and saw they had an &#34;Outlet&#34; which had the original MOD1 speakers for $94.00 with factory blemishes but your required to buy 50 feet of speaker wire at $28.00 which brings the price basically to the same as the MOD1X. If the MOD1X is an updated version at $124.00 + $9.00 for S&H on their website who would buy a 10 year old version that is blemished for the same price.? This seems like deceptive marketing to me that is intended to draw in unknowledgeable people and should be below a company with such a good reputation IMO. Besides if they offered the MOD1's at $70.00 or so they might get a lot of new customers who would probably purchase the new one's at full retail. So since I'm so happy with these Boston Acoustics Soundware speakers and the 4 1/2&#34; Black one's are $74.00 here on Amazon which is only $5.00 more than the XS Satellite's are and $25.00 less than the White 4 1/2&#34; speakers are I will probably add 1 as the center speaker since the Receiver and HDTV are black as well and it will sit next to the receiver. Who knows I may wire in a second one together on the other side at this price and still have spent $100.00 less than the Orb's. Since I'm on a fixed income this seems the most logical way to complete this system. SORRY ORB. UPDATE; 06/01/2015: After speaking with Will at Orb Audio I was told you don't have to buy the speaker wire to buy an older orb on the outlet part of their website. I have decided to purchase a &#34;single pack&#34; in pearl or ice white as they call it with their 30 day in home trial to hear the difference between the Orb and the Soundware. I also plan to wire a second orb in parallel on each side of my receiver as center speakers. This is how they create their systems and can grow to pretty much any size based on what your amp can put out. With this in mind I plan to add a MOD2X twin pack as the surround speakers and wire my 2 1/2&#34; B.A.'s to the 4 1/2&#34; as the fronts. This all depends on $ and how the first orb sounds but I believe it will push the 4 1/2&#34; except maybe at the bass end. Also by adding more speakers in this manner you can crank it up without worrying about blowing anything not to mention a fuller sound.  Don't get me wrong as I'm very pleased with the Soundware  speakers as well and wish to take advantage of the Diamond/Circle configuration plus the small size and even the speaker covers in the black or white from one company to the other match. I'll update this again next week after testing the Orb. UPDATE; 06/07/15: I received my first Pearl White Orb and have been testing it ever since. First the two colors are a perfect match but the Orb is metal and looks a little brighter or shinier and the speaker cover is a hair smaller gauge but look remarkably the same. The Soundware and XS seem to have a cloth under the aluminum cover so you only see a dark outline where the Orb you can see the light and dark grey of the speaker underneath which I prefer.  From my testing ofSmooth Jazz, Classical, Light Classical and Easy Listening I was able to hear all types of instruments and to these old ears the two are very similar sounding although the Orb MOD1X is a bit brighter than the 4 1/2&#34; and the 2 1/2&#34; B.A.'s. The 4 1/2&#34;er's have more BASS than the Orb but not a whole lot. I believe this is to be expected going from a 3&#34; to a 4 1/2&#34; speaker.  All in all they both look really good together and most important sound good together and I expect them all to open up more in the next few weeks. I'll try to post some photos soon but for now I don't believe you can find a more compact, complimentary pairing and the Black would also go with any of the Orb's other finishes as they all have black speaker covers.  I will be adding only Orb's to this system since I want one or two wired to the Fronts and for the Surround Speakers while moving the XS's to the Center channel. I would also add the Toss Pearl White stands in time if I can afford to. I measured and the Mod 2X's on the Toss would  appear to sit right on top of the 4 1/2&#34; B.A.'s on my 21 1/2&#34; high accent tables. COOL!. &#34; A SUGGESTION TO ORB &#34;, Create a 4 1/2&#34; or so MOD1XL, MOD2XL and MOD4XL to really cover bass and mids especially as Fronts or Mains and I doubt any one could compete in the sound for size category. If you do send me some to test and review. PLEASE!  Since the color, size and most of all sound is so complimentary I now feel this is a success and can only get fuller and better as I add to it. UPDATE ; 06/16/2015; ( WARNING, WARNING, WARNING) This has been quite an experience but I have found out that other reviewer's are correct in that there is a &#34;Major Problem&#34; with the sub's auto shut down circuitry. Mine stopped working after 3 weeks and would not turn back on so I returned the whole 2.1 system and ordered my second Orb MOD1X and a Yamaha Subwoofer that's tuned to my receiver and has no auto circuitry so I should have no more problem with the sub. I kept the 4 1/2&#34;Soundware's as my Fronts but the rest are and will be Orb's. I will eventually wire Orb's to the Fronts to add more clarity.  I gave this 2 stars and would give it more based on sound, quality and design but not with this kind of problem.",2015-05-24

The monitor was arbitrarily shutting itself off (without me either shutting down my computer, or pressing the monitors power button). Yes, I already checked my power-saver settings; it's not that. Earlier, I'd purchased a new VGA cable, then later, even a new graphics card (see the review I wrote for that). I was just replacing things to determine what was causing my monitor to blink repeatedly and shut off for a few seconds at a time.<br /><br />I gave this power cord a 4-star rating because, while I'm sure it's doing the job, and it arrived in good time, it did not actually solve my problem. My monitor is still going black for a few seconds every so often, but at least now its power-on indicator light is not shutting off when the screen goes black.<br /><br />I am sure the power cord is fine, as is the VGA cable. Apparently, my nearly-9-year-old monitor is slowly dying. It's just the result of being a work-a-holic and having my monitor on all day. Yes, I do shut my computer & peripherals down every night; but now, to preserve my monitor, I am puting everything on 'Stand-By' every time I leave my computer for a break.",2015-08-09

Full disclosure: I have not tried any other noise-cancelling headphones, so this review is not a comparative analysis but more a straightforward assessment of this product alone.<br /><br />Sound Quality: 5/5<br />These really have ruined all other headphones for me. The sound quality is great -- I listen to a pretty vast array of music and have always been pleased with their performance. Again, I don't have any other products of similar quality to compare them to, but coming from the traditional iphone earbuds, these are an exponential improvement.<br /><br />Noise Canceling: 4.5/5<br />I am currently in grad school and stuffed into an office with five other (uncharacteristically personable and chatty) scientists. Generally, if I just want to sort of dim out the noise, I find the noise cancelling itself to be pretty sufficient. You can still here aimless chatter or keyboard strokes in the background, but it's so much easier to tune out. If, however, you play music (even softly), the noise cancelling drastically improves. I find that I can work away in my own little world for a few hours with much less distraction when I am wearing these. I have also worn these a few times on airplanes -- they do a great job of cancelling out the roaring of engines and whatever else makes airplanes unbearably loud.<br /><br />Comfort: 4.7/5<br />That brings me to my next topic...I generally wear these for hours at a time and have not had any problems with discomfort. My only annoyance is that they kind of squeeze my glasses against the sides of my head, so I usually end up taking the glasses off after a bit. This might be something that is pretty typical of any headphone, though. I have a reasonably-sized head, and don't find them to be too tight or anything like that, and I have never experienced headaches or pain from these. In a typical day I will wear them anywhere from an hour to maybe four to five hours, and mostly just forget I have them on after a while. Additionally, after six months of nearly daily wear, they have not lost any of their &#34;springy-ness&#34; and still fit to my head just fine.<br /><br />Battery life: 4.5/5<br />I use these a lot (almost daily) and change the battery every few weeks or so. Batteries are expensive and annoying BUT my personal feelings about them aside, I think these headphones have a pretty good power lifetime.<br /><br />Carrying case: 5/5<br />Not sure how important this really is, but the case is small but with a surprising amount of space for other things. I usually throw a few extra batteries in the little zipper pocket, and sometimes even cram my phone into the case without any issue.<br /><br />In general, I use these as my go-to office or home headphones. As a daily-use product, I find these to be excellent.",2015-02-11

I was able to load up a 128gb usb3 flash drive with music, connect it to the ibasso usb port and see/hear all the files there.  VERY nice!  did not work for ssd's over usb but did work for thumbdrives.<br /><br />touch screen is annoying, though.  too sensitive.  the general controls are ok.  could be better and better positioned but they are usable as-is.<br /><br />size of unit is nice (small but not too small or too large).  case is aluminum and would hold up well.<br /><br />just wish it was truly a bit-perfect 24/192k player.  darn.  so close!",2015-03-28

I'm sure these headphones are good for that. These headphones are really douchey though and I hate the way I can't listen to music with out feeling it move and tickle my ears and so much bass can give you a headache. And if you try sliding the bass down to a spot that is just right, certain parts of the song will cut out.

It's the brand we depend on for alerts. The best thing about an alert radio is it sits quietly on a shelf until NOAA sends out an alert. You can go about your daily business or sleep soundly knowing the alarm on the radio will wake you in case of severe weather or any other matter for which you should be informed. (Local and state government agencies also have use of the NWS services if they would just put some simple procedures in place. For instance, the Forest Service could notify the closest NWS station to put out an alert on a wildfire. Unfortunately, that service is not being utilized. I still have hopes.....)    We have two of these radios. One is in the house and the other is in the workshop. The one in the workshop is hooked up to external speakers so we can hear the alerts if we're out on the ranch. While we may not be able to understand the alert if we're far away from the building, we'll hear the tone and know to get back to the house to listen to the alert. Unless it's stormy weather, the hunters who have a cabin about a quarter of a mile away can hear the radio alert and they either check the weather on their IPhones or call us to see what's happening.    This new unit replaces the same model of alert radio we had in the workshop for about ten years. It took great umbrage with a lightning strike that was way too close to the speakers. We've had the unit in the house about 12 years. We like the Reecom brand because they've produced dependable alert radios.    This is not to take away from the other alert radios. We just like the Reecom brand. Everyone needs to have an alert radio in their home just like they need smoke detectors in their home. An alert radio could save your life or the life of someone you love. They make great gifts for the people you care about and want to keep safe.    The supplier for this unit had it in our hands within a week of my placing the order. Great service (left a note on seller feedback).",2015-01-04

First, let me say that I have used several different devices for listening to music when I swim: waterproof case for ipod nano, waterproof case for ipod shuflle, two different models from Finis with the most recent being the Neptune) and now the Diver. I will never use the waterproof case again, I had one leak and lost an ipod. The Neptune is a nice device with great sound, but is not cheap and I have had to return it twice. Currently it works but the shuffle function does not.<br />Now to the Diver. The device was easy to figure out right out of the box. I hooked it up to my macbook, loaded up a bunch of songs with no trouble, let it get charged and took it to the pool. The size is great, it clips right on the band of your goggles and you won't even notice it is there once you get going. Changing between sings is pretty easy, even while swimming.<br />Now on to the one issue I have with the Diver which is in regards to the sound quality. So when I first put the ear pieces in I did not have the unit at max volume and I got in the water and as soon as I submerged the earpieces came out. Now, I do have some cauliflower ear from years of wrestling so having ear pieces pop out is nothing new, but I wrapped the cord for the headphones in a different manner to give a little torque on the ear pieces and then they stayed in.<br />The bigger issue came when I was swimming and water was able to get in between my ear and the ear piece. Several reviewers had noted this as well. I could hardly hear anything. As soon as I pulled my head out of water and it drained I could hear again and the music sounded fine. I tried pushing it in a little differently, but after a while water would get in and I couldn't hear. I then turned up the volume all the way. Water still came in, but I could hear the music, it was just faint. I had run into similar issueswith the ipod waterproof case headphones but I think the max volume may have been higher because I don't remember it being as much of an issue.<br />The music can go from muffled to quite audible during a swim, depending on your stroke. They should either design the earphones to create a water tight seal or increase the power of the max volume (although the latter resolution could make the music quite loud when dry).<br />I think for the price this is a very nice unit. I have not had any other issues. I have been on several swims now without a recharge and could see using it in other situations: running in the rain, mud or some other situation where a regular mp3 player or phone could be damaged. I hope they are able to come up with a resolution for the ear piece issue as that is a drawback for me.",2015-05-21

(Pink),Electronics,3,0,0,N,Y,The good: I have used this player in the rain ...,"I bought my first Diver mp3 player this past spring.  I am a runner and I was tired of shelling out cash for mp3 players that died when I ran in the rain or really hot days as sweat has ruined many players too.<br /><br />The good:  I have used this player in the rain with no issues.  I like how I can attach it to my shorts with the clip.  It is very easy to operate while running.  It is very easy to load and unload songs using my computer.  The sound quality meets my needs equally on par with my various ipods and Samsung Galaxy S5.  This little sucker is very close to being a home run for all of my needs as a runner, but 2 significant flaws hold it back from being great.<br /><br />The bad:  The head phone jack.  Like I said I am a runner.  So I prefer to wear headphones that do not block out all outside noise.  Thus the swimming headphones that are meant to plug your ears with the in-ear rubber to avoid water penetration (and thus all outside sounds) are not good for me.  And the sound quality of the provided headphones are lacking.  So when I plug in my higher end yurbuds that allow ambient sounds (to avoid getting hit by a car), the sound quality is much better.  But wait!  This mp3 player is not user friendly to other headphones!  I have to insert the headphones into the jack about 95% of the way to get great sound in both ears.  If I insert the whole way, the sounds quality is muffled and goes in & out.  Damn it!  It will not work for running with normal headphones (I tried 4-5 different pairs with no luck.  The jack prong on the headphones provided is slightly shorter in length.  So the standard length prong you will find on just about all headphones besides the ones that come with this player are almost useless.  Yes, you can sit at a desk and enjoy the sound with it plugged in 95% into the jack.  But while running this is not possible.  Yet I did find some little extension cord from JBL in my huge box of various audio and computer cords that I slightly modified to seat into the player to provide optimum sound and then plugged my yurbuds into the extension.  It worked great for 300+ miles of running.  So I ordered another player.  And disclaimer:  I was sent another for free if I would write a review.  Since then my extension cord has become faulty.  So I can only use the headphones provided which I do not feel comfortable using while running because they block out all sound.<br /><br />So all in all, they are now paperweights for me and I am back to my search for a runner-friendly, waterproof mp3 player.  Such a shame that they do not use a standard headphone jack or it would be 95% perfect player.  The only other improvement would be to have a shuffle option instead of playing the songs in order as they are loaded as the only option.",2015-08-11

This antenna does a nice job if you are not interested in installing exterior one & running cable everywhere. Elevation here is high w/ many surrounding areas higher.

They fit securely around my head but not so tight that I end up with a headache the next morning. I really like how they keep my headphones in place while I am sleeping since I do toss and turn a lot during the night. Yeah I suppose they are probably meant for travel purposes but that is not when I use them. I have been using these nightly and its pretty much become routine for me grab them, put them on and start using them at bed time. They do block out the horrible snoring that my husband does. The headphones sound great. My daughter will even use them while she is doing her homework of an evening and she likes them as well. The only thing that I wish was different with these was if they could somehow be bluetooth headphones. That would work out so much better for me since I do toss and turn at night while I am sleeping.

I've found it to be ideal for home studio use. To be perfectly honest I cannot detect any difference between this and the Standard 100 model.

You can hear every little detail and in perfect directional measure of distance because of the great sound-stage. People complaining about bass? Well, I think its perfect with these, you have to keep in mind that they are open headphones. Also, due to the open design, very open, you can hear things going on around you, but if you crank up the volume this eliminates that problem for the most part. It is true though, if you have a medium to smaller head beware, the compression headband that is supposed to &#34;self adjust&#34; is light on compression, so you have to you a rubber band to increase the compression, 3 1/2&#34; is perfect. Quick fix. The cushions on the ear pads could be a tad deeper as well. I didn't think that I had big ears, but they touch the material separating them from the drivers in most headphones. Either I was wrong in my assumption or they just make most headsets and headphones for tiny eared people. But still don't have discomfort wearing them for hours.

Pretty sure if I had spent twice the money I maybe would get 10% improvement in sound but I am very happy with my purchase.  Be sure to get the right sub cord.  They give three different connection methods in the instructions but the most common is not  very well outlined.  The sub line out from the amplifier to line in at the speaker is really simple in a single RCA connector configuration but it took me a minute because there are R and L line ins on the speaker.

Excellent battery life.,"Bought the Jarv NMotion because I needed this style of bluetooth earphone with good battery life. My Plantronics BackBeat GO 2 looks good but has DISMAL battery life! I am lucky to get 3.5 hours when listening to music and podcasts. The rechargeable battery pack stopped working after three weeks.<br /><br />With the Jarv NMotion Pro BT earphones I'm getting 6-7 hours of continuous music and podcast playback. Of course, volume and bass draw more power on all these type earphones, but I am completely satisfied with the Jarv battery life. The audio quality is also better than Plantronics BackBeat GO 2. I also like how Jarv powers itself down when not connected to a BT device. Come with a variety of accessories to aid with a good ear fit.<br /><br />The only downsides are: 1) The Jarv NMotion earphones are ugly and look bulky when compared to the competition. The more powerful/larger battery is likely the reason for the bulky look, but I'm happy to have longer battery life rather than a slicker appearance. 2) There is also an annoying flashing blue LED on the volume/on/off control when the earphone is on and connected.

The sound is excellent at low to mid volumes and at the highest volumes can get a bit distorted but for the size, price, and portability, this does exactly what it should. Would definitely recommend.",2015-04-06

However, this unit turns itself off during the night and thus does not sound the alarm.  You have to push the 'on' button again for it to turn back on-that makes it useless as a morning alarm.

The sound quality is surprisingly good, i didn't expect that sound from such a tiny device. You might not feel the bass  in your body  but you can definitely hear  it.  You could actually  feel the bass if you place it near to you at bed. Very nice sound with crispy  treble, well balanced mids and punchy bass. But don't expect  too much bass from this speaker . If you want +5db of bass form a device of this size then you would have to invest at least +$150 more in another model from another company  We test it at the Michigan lake in the open and we have been impressed by the sound, very nice and loud. You can still hear the bass. The connection and pairing seem to work better if the speaker is turned on after the source . It will turn off after some period of inactivity. This is good to preserve its energy but you will have to press the power button again if you want to connect it. It will reconnect to the last paired source if its bluetooth radio  is ready.  Be patience in figuring out the connection process for one or more devices . It can connect to only one device at the time  via bluetooth . I haven't measured the battery life but it last all day at least, under consistent use  . The Mac OS X Bluetooth file explorer reports a bit rate of 325 kbps @ 42kHz using the SBC codec, which is enough to transmit a  good quality sound I am very pleased with this gadget, very convenient, great build quality and sound .

That would make it a lot more convenient.<br />-Now, this might just be me, but the little black plate with SARDINE on it bothers me.

With the 4 D Cells in it, the radio has some heft to it. I like that in a portable radio. Tuning knob is very firm...almost too firm.  Band switches are very firm as well and definitely not loose or flimsy.<br />As far as performance;<br />MW -  Not the best, but satisfactory for local stations and the usual 50kW blow torches at night. The unit is not very good at DX on MW, even when directionally tuning the unit. I use a Terk AM loop antenna to help boost AM signal reception.<br /><br />SW - Pretty good IMO.  SW signals are strong and surprisingly clear...even with spurious noise from within my house.  I've hooked up a 27 ft long wire reel antenna to the unit and that has boosted SW reception quality.  Otherwise, SW off just the whip is decent.<br /><br />FM - Great performance.  FM signals are clear, deep and strong. The RDS is a nice added feature.<br /><br />Programming - Kind of tricky at first, especially since no user manual was included in the box (had to download one online).  Once you see the programming instructions and get a feel for it, programming the radio is relatively easy going forward<br /><br />Backlight - The Backlight has 3 levels. I like it.  The orange readout is clear, crisp and easy to read.<br /><br />Overall, I rate this radio 4 stars.  MW performance could be better and there was no users manual included.

The sound far exceeds most speakers at this price point, and small form factor. I was looking for an inexpensive yet decent sounding speaker for outdoor barbecues and trips to the beach, and this certainly fits the bill. Does it have &#34;booming bass&#34; as some others have stated, not really, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised if you purchase this understanding that booming bass is uncommon at this price and size.<br /><br />These things being said, as others have mentioned, the biggest issue with this speaker is the overly loud voice which announces pairing status. It truly needs correcting. I find myself holding the speaker into a pillow when pairing as it blasts out so loud. Should I really have to do this? Should I have to face the angry stares at the beach when my speaker blares out &#34;Connected!!!&#34; at full volume? Should I scare the living day lights out of my dog (and myself) each time the battery starts running low? I don't think so.<br /><br />A word of warning, do not fall asleep while using this speaker as you will probably be woken up very rudely hearing &#34;Battery Low!&#34; As I was last night.<br /><br /> A very similar DKnight speaker used to have the same issue which was corrected with a firmware update. I would hope Soundbot would do the same, if not I may cut my losses and buy a different speaker, despite being happy with all other aspects of the SB571, which would be very disappointing.",2015-05-28

It has to do with the engineering of the pivot points. This product is so much sturdier, heavier, and just overall better made. Do yourself a favor and buy this product. No sagging and the swivel function is extremely stable. I have a 55 inch Samsung that weighs around 45 lbs. The only thing I recommend is hand tightening the lag bolts. I pre drilled my holes with the user manual directed drill bit size and then used an impact wrench to start the lag bolts. One of them snapped because I put way to much torque to it. When I used a hand rachet to tighten them, the lag bolts help up just fine. Highly recommend this product for anybody looking for a swivel mount.

I have a wide open studio space on the upper level of my home & needed an AirPlay solution to fill the area. First I tried the B&W Zeppelin because I have the exact same speaker in a smaller room in my home. Well imagine my disappointment once I realized that the mid bass & low end that sounded quite pleasant in my smaller room was totally non-existent in the larger studio style room/space. I know, I know a total brain freeze moment, audio stuff 101, when selecting components, the space matters as much as the component itself. So anyway after fiddling around with placement of the Zeppelin in order to increase bass output I eventually gave up & came back to Amazon to began researching other AirPlay speakers considered by customers who also considered the Zeppelin. And that's when I came across the JBL. I began by looking at the L8, the smaller/cheaper 2 way version but because I knew I wanted low end & not just mid bass I went ahead, bit the money bullet & began looking/researching the L16 exclusively.<br />The L16 is a great sounding speaker, the mid vocals may lack some of the refinement found in the Zeppelin, but the low end more than makes up for that. One thing to note is that you will have to download & use the JBL app in order to adjust/increase the bass level on the speaker.<br />If you can justify the price, & overcome any name bias you may have, you will love this speaker.  Perfect for a large space where critical listening is not your goal but you still want quality sound.",2015-02-08

I started by examining the outside package which already beats the packaged of the 2 mentioned brands by far the packaging is by far superior, but you can't judge a book by it's cover though. I went and broke the seal of the box and again I was amazed on how the packaged the inside of the carton, V-MODA took great care and detail to make sure that everything is very neat. The outer shell casing is an excellent design and is pretty hard and will withstand drops and maybe 10lbs or so of pressure wouldn't want to smash or step on the case with the headphones it but would do great just thrown in a bag on the go, however there is a carabiner clip that comes with this to attach to the outside of your bag for easy carrying and fast loading when you are done with them.<br /><br />When wearing these you will know you are wearing headphones and not like the others that are made with mostly plastic and are really light. These headphones have a little heft to them, but when you put them on your ears they are the most comfortable headphones around. The ear cushions are very soft and can be worn for long periods of time. There is barely any sound that leaks from these headphones when the volume is all the way up. There is no distortion in the sound and everything sounds so crisp including the bass which you can feel around your ears. These are not your noise cancellation but noise isolation which prevents sound leakage and also cuts back on some of the outside noise that you get when you wear a lot of the on the ear headphones which is great because more of the sound stays in your ears and not out.<br /><br />I have given this a try by playing many different types of music and by far this can handle anything you throw at it. These aren't your $250 + headphones but what you get is a great headphone set at a great price that I honestly believe sounds much better than the Beats Studio or the latest Bose headphones minus the Quiet Comforts which are actually noise cancelling and are pretty good but that is if you want to fork over 3 large bills which I did when I bought the QC 3's back in 2007. I wanted something that was more affordable and yet sound quality along with build quality is there, something that is much durable than a lightweight piece of plastic. I wouldn't waste much time looking at other headphones. Just look at the total number of reviews and star ratings for the V-MODA Crossfade LP's and see for yourself that this is a trusted brand  Like the packaging says INSPIRED in ITALY and STYLED in HOLLYWOOD you can't go wrong.",2015-07-17

Also understand that speaker selection is highly subjective.  What I look for in a speaker, another person may not think it important and vice-versa.  Ask a dozen people their favorite speaker and you are likely to get a dozen different answers.  Note 2: This speaker’s model designation has changed from E5Bi (when I purchased them) to R5Bi.  Most of EMP Tek's Impression Series lineup has changed to show an &#34;R&#34; designator instead of the &#34;E&#34; designator, which now corresponds to RBH Sound.  First, a little history.  I own the stereo system I've always wanted for music. It includes Magnepan, McIntosh, Oppo, SVS plus other equipment picked up over the years.  The system I use for watching movies is another story entirely (and far too long to get into).  I'll just say that I wanted to join the 21st century and expand my little 2.1 system to a 3.1 system, then to a 5.1 system when I get the ambition to crawl around my attic and run cables down between the wall studs.  And I wanted to do this inexpensively.  While outstanding sound quality and stage presentation are of paramount importance to me in enjoying music, irregardless of price, it's never been more than a passing thought for movies.  After all, an explosion or a street buckling is hardly the same as fingers sliding on a guitar string, plucking a harp or a soaring voice.  So I plopped down an inexpensive speaker system, added a powerful PSA sub for LFE, then sat back perfectly content and called it a day … until the bug hit.  And to satisfy that bug, I began researching and auditioning speakers over a year ago (I've owned these speakers since August of 2014).  Well, I can honestly say that nothing much has changed.  I again plopped down an inexpensive speaker system to go along with my powerful subwoofer.  Matter-of-fact, this speaker system is even less expensive than my old system.  Why even bother?  That's what I thought, until I began my audition.  So who is EMP Tek?  I learned it was an internet-direct company whose parent company is RBH Sound.  While EMP Tek is very much alive and successful, RBH has acquired all rights to the EMP Tek branding.  One can order this Impression Series speaker through either RBH Sound or EMP Tek.  I've heard of RBH, but never auditioned their highly regarded speakers (until now).  And since return shipping wouldn't cost me more than 25 bucks, I thought, why not?  I placed my order and auditioned the EMP Teks in my home.  I tested the speakers in stereo mode for the first two weeks and played nothing but music.  No center channel (hadn't purchased it yet).  No surrounds (that's down the road).  No subwoofer (didn't hook it up).  No movies.  I feel a pair of speakers must stand on their own.  They must reproduce music to a very high standard and in a transparent fashion, while rendering a realistic and open sound stage.  A tall order, but if they can do all that, then they will be more than suitable for movie viewing.  Did these speakers pass the muster and stand on their own?  The answer is … not quite, and is one of the reason why this rating was difficult for me.  My first impression of the R5Bi bookshelf speakers when I pulled them from the box was surprise.  They were smaller than I thought they would be, but what a beautiful and elegant looking pair of little speakers!  The pictures on their website are good, but don't quite do them justice.  These rear-ported speakers were dwarfed by the Def Tech Studio Monitors and several others I had auditioned.  Each speaker is 12-3/4&#34; H x 6-7/8&#34; W x 8&#34; D and look a bit inadequate and lonely sitting atop the large speaker stands I had purchased.  The stands were almost as expensive as these speakers (and often are more expensive).  What the heck was I thinking?  Obviously, I wasn't thinking of EMP Tek.  Yet, there I sat witha smile on my face staring at the E5Bi's immaculate high-gloss, deep red burl finish.  Vinyl or no vinyl, it is impressive.  And that finish encompassed the top, bottom, back and sides of the speakers.  I couldn't possibly be looking at a $225/pair of speakers, could I?  Well, not so fast.  I didn't see anything special about the speaker itself other than its finish and nicely curved shape.  It has a 5-1/4 inch driver with a 1-inch dome tweeter.  Hmmm, where have I have seen those before?  Everywhere (although the R5Bi uses fabric).  There was a hint of it being a budget speaker in the high-gloss black finish on the front bezel.  I know what piano black looks like, and this isn't it.  The bezel has a shiny, plastic look to it.  Actually, it closely resembles the black plastic bezel on my Samsung LCD, but the black cloth grille covers almost all of that surface, leaving only the edges exposed.  In truth, it looks like a speaker that may cost 4 or 5 times as much or more.  That deep red burl finish was quite elegant and very nicely implemented.  Another hint that it might be a budget speaker, is its weight.  It's fairly light at 7-1/2 pounds each, but didn't feel at all shoddy or cheap.  The tap test on the sides and back of the speaker gave a hollow sound, which did worried me.  The curved sides seemed far too thin of a material and I felt it could suffer from resonances.  Tapping the top and bottom presented a dead sound.  There were no threaded inserts on the bottom to allow screw mounting, so these are meant to be placed on a stand (I never recommend bookshelf speakers to sit on or in a bookshelf) and come with four rubber feet glued to the bottom.  There are, however, two threaded inserts at the rear of the speaker to attach a bracket for wall mounting.  The speaker terminals at the rear can accept banana plugs or one can attach bare wire.  I chose bare wire, but do have the other ends terminated with banana plugs at the AVR for quick release.  The R5Bi's are rated from 60 Hz - 20 kHz, plus/minus 3 dB, so they are bass shy.  And they aren't the most sensitive speakers on planet Earth with an 85dB sensitivity rating, but they have an 8 Ohm nominal impedance, and if they are similar to their R55Ti towers, that impedance won't dip much within their frequency range.  This means that pretty much any AVR with decent wattage should drive them to loud volumes.  But I'm not talking reference levels here, because I don't go there.  I listen at moderate to high volume levels -- low to mid 80 dB peaks and on occasion the high 80s and perhaps even 90 dB peaks when I get carried away.  The AVRs I tested them with are not exactly powerhouses.  These were a Denon with 95 watts/channel and a Marantz with 90 watts/channel.  Pretty standard fare, but each AVR drove the R5Bi's above my preferred loudness levels without showing signs of stress on the amps (other than both amps getting hot, which is typical for AVRs) nor any stress or distortion from the speakers.  My biggest concern was, do the R5Bi's sound like budget speakers?  Well, I first must tell you what I was comparing them to.  Certainly not my 6-foot tall Maggies, which cost well over 20 times as much.  That would be like pitting David without his sling against Goliath, both in stature and sound.  And that was the most difficult part of this audition -- not to compare them.  It's not like I can suddenly wipe the Maggie sound from my mind.  Yet, I knew I'd have to make this adjustment.  I also knew I'd be making major concessions for any bookshelf speaker, so I didn't hold out much hope for a small pair of bass shy $225 speakers, no matter how highly Andrew Robinson praised them.  It was Andrew's 5-star stellar review at HomeTheaterReview that enticed me to audition them in the first place.  On a side note, it was also Andrew Robinson's review of the Magnepan 3.6 that influenced my decision to audition them 5 years ago.  Hmmm, perhaps I should learn never to question any of Andrew's reviews.  I did try my best to limit my comparison to the $300 Zvox 550 platform speaker that the R5Bi's will be replacing.  Before laughing too hard, I have a few things to say about that Zvox.  The Zvox 550 (not the slightly audibly inferior newer versions) has a … wait for it … 5-1/4 inch bass driver.  It also comes with five 2-inch drivers.  Because it's a large volume ported enclosure, the Zvox can go deeper than the R5Bi's.  It was bench tested by Sound&Vision at 54 Hz at the -3dB point and 48 Hz at the -6 dB point, and has no trouble getting to 50 Hz with solid output, where the R5Bi's are rated at 60 Hz and probably not a cycle more.  However, what bass the R5Bi's could produce I enjoyed.  It was precise and controlled, just not deep.  The midrange on the Zvox is smooth and very easy on the ears.  The midrange on the R5Bi's were equally as smooth, if not better, plus I could pick out far more definition within the details, but I also noticed a very slight forwardness in a few pieces of music.  In other words, for bass response it's the Zvox, while the midrange goes to the EMP Tek.  However, that is where any reasonably close comparisons end.  The Zvox couldn't keep up in the upper midrange and lower treble frequencies.  The R5Bi's were clean to the point of being pristine.  On the high treble frequencies the R5Bi's retained their composure no matter the volume, but there were times that I felt they were giving all they could possibly give and no more.  I didn't hear distortion, harshness, nor anything that would even raise an eyebrow.  It was more like they just ran out of gas.  That told me they have very good, but not exceptional, high frequency capabilities.  As nice as the R5Bi's tweeters are, one won't think they are listening to ribbon tweeters (but ribbon tweeters can cost more than three or four R5Bi speakers).  What about the sound stage?  The Zvox sound stage is unique because it is quite flexible.  It can be tuned wide or gradually narrowed bythe use of PhaseCue to enhance the dialog, but even at its widest, the Zvox feels very constrained, especially in height.  The R5Bi's throw out an unexpected large, open and detailed sound stage, and beat the Zvox handily.  Heck, its soundstage beat all of the bookshelf speakers I had auditioned.  The depth of sound stage clearly trumped the Zvox, and played deeper than I had anticipated.  I also found the R5Bi's imaging capabilities easily superior to the Zvox, and could be attributed to the R5Bi's overall pristine clarity, dispersion characteristics and the Zvox's PhaseCue.  If not used carefully, PhaseCue can be a double-edged sword.  However, the R5Bi's &#34;sweet&#34; spot (its stereo phantom center in a 2.0 configuration) at the listening position didn't match its large sound stage.  It was more narrow than I was expecting.  Perhaps it could be attributed to the less than ideal speaker locations to the listening position, and the closeness of the speakers to that listening position.  One always tries to use an equilateral triangle as a rough guide, which I couldn't quite accomplish in my room.  However, I did do some minor location adjustments which expanded and solidified the sweet spot to what I was expecting.  There is no hiding the fact that the R5Bi's are a bit bass shy, but so are a lot of highly regarded bookshelf speakers (the very expensive KEF LS50s come to mind — they only get down to 79 Hz).  However, the R5Bi's attributes are many and not insignificant.  I found the R5Bi's to be a surprising and extremely capable little speaker.  Like any speaker, it is not perfect and I wondered if I was picking up cabinet resonances on rare occasions, but this budget speaker sounds far, FAR better than I ever gave it any hope for.  The R5Bi's are clear, open, precise, and virtually uncolored (or neutral), but must have a subwoofer to round out the sound.  They have the ability to bring out fine details, yet I felt they can be just a bit dry or clinical at times, but my room acoustics may have played a part in this.  And as I stated prior, with certain artists they sounded slightly more forward than I'm use to, especially on the Norah Jones, &#34;Come Away With Me&#34; CD.  But that CD was probably miked and mixed for that approach.  On most music, such as rock, jazz or classical, I didn't notice it being overly forward, and sat back and enjoyed the music.  And as neutral sounding as they are, they will hit hard with authority when called upon, and do so without strain.  There is no simple way for me to correlate this natural, effortless and pristine sound quality with its price tag.  If I had one word to describe the R5Bi's, it would be &#34;Howdidtheydothat4$225?&#34;.  Yep, that's one word.  While these speakers gave me many unexpected and very pleasant surprises, they didn't thrill me.  The Maggies thrill me every day.  The Martin Logan Summits and Ethos that I had auditioned thrilled me.  And at those prices, they had better thrill me.  But one isn't expecting to be thrilled at this price point, nor at any price point near it.  And let's face it, I have never been thrilled with any conventional box speaker.  I confess to being a &#34;panel guy&#34; through and through.  I was more concerned with just getting through the audition without hating them.  That mission was accomplished, but it didn't exactly happen over night.  It progressed steadily and in stages as I slowly began to forget about the Maggies and paid much closer attention to the R5Bi's and what they actually brought to the table.  That is why in-home auditions are so important.  It gives one a chance to live with the sound, and not make snap judgments.  And when I finally decided to add my subwoofer into the mix a few weeks into the audition, it opened up a bold and impressive new world.  No matter how good or how average I think a speaker may be, solid, deep bass is too important not to have it when and where it counts.  I wouldn't use these speakers, nor the $1500 KEFs, without a sub.  Instead, I'd opt for other speakers -- perhaps towers or larger bookshelf speakers from several companies I've been eyeing. Fortunately, I'm using a subwoofer, so it's a moot point.  And with that sub, my remaining doubts quickly vanished.  Strange how that happens.  It seems a sub adds a new dimension to the EMP Teks, or any speaker, giving the feeling they perform well beyond their capabilities at all frequencies, not just the bass frequencies.  Crossing these over at 80 Hz permitted the R5Bi’s to play even louder without strain.  A sub actually allows bookshelf speakers to shine, and the EMP Tek's shined brightly indeed.  After a little over two weeks, I ordered a third R5Bi to test as a center channel.  Why not buy a speaker that was specifically designed as a center channel?  Center channels are a compromise by locating their speaker components (midrange/tweeter/midrange, or MTM configuration) horizontally.  So I saw no difference in placing the third R5Bi on its side and began testing.  I simply like identical speakers, and with its large soundstage (both in height and width) it seemed to me to be a natural to try out, even when turned on its side.  Ideally, one would place this speaker vertically on a stand, and at the same height as the left and right channels.  But speaker placement is rarely ideal in any home, and until I decide to move the TV to a wall-mount at a higher elevation, what I have now will just have to do.  I will say that it is working out even better than I expected.  So much so, that I feel no need to move my TV to the wall.  Between 1 and 10, I rate the R5Bi's a very solid 8 out of 10, or 4 stars.  It would be so easy to give this speaker 5 stars, and even without a subwoofer, they deserve high praise.  They are quite exceptional for the price, and I doubt many speakers under $600 could accomplish all that the R5Bi's were able to accomplish in so many areas sonically, nor look nearly as good doing it.  Matter-of-fact, I preferred these over the $900 Def Tech Studio Monitor.  So why the final 4-star rating?  Because there were speakers I've auditioned that came close in several areas, and exceeded them in bass output and depth.  Yes, I'm talking almost three or four times the cost, but we are not talking about a lot of money here.  And if one thinks about it, needing to add a sub places the R5Bi's cost in a whole new light.  They simply cannot play the full musical spectrum on their own.  That is the main reason for the 4-star rating.  In reality, very few bookshelf speakers can play the full musical spectrum, but if they can reach under 50 Hz to the mid 40 Hz range or so, a subwoofer won't be an immediate concern.  Just know that with a quality subwoofer these are easily 5-star speakers, and will hold their own with speakers several times their cost and surpass a good portion of them.  Yes, I believe they are that good.  So for people not interested in adding a subwoofer, I'd highly recommend getting speakers with deeper bass capabilities, such as the EMP Tek R55Ti towers at $695/pair or Definitive Technology SM-55 bookshelf speakers @ $600/pair, and if you like the unique looks, go for the very highly regarded JBL Studio 530s for $600.  These were high on my list to audition, but there are many high quality speakers to choose from in the $600 and under price range from companies like Ascend Acoustics, NHT, Hsu, etc.  I must say that I really liked the Def Tech SM-55 model, and enjoyed them more than their smaller SM-45 model and thought they were better balanced than their larger SM-65 model.  Actually, I was almost positive that the SM-55 is what I'd end up with (or possibly the JBL), thus the more robust speaker stands.  I had auditioned the Def Techs on three different occasions, just to be sure.  Then why the EMP Tek over the Def Tech, when the Def Techs had such an eye popping bass response down to the mid and low 40s Hz range?  It was the pristine clarity ofthe midrange and highs, and the surprisingly large sound stage of the R5Bi's that ruled the day for me. That, and I have a subwoofer.  So for those who have a subwoofer, or those on a budget who want to spend the money the R5Bi's will save to help buy that sub, the EMP Tek's are a wise and very fashionable choice.  After all this time, do these little &#34;Davids&#34; still feel totally unarmed versus the mighty Goliath Maggies?  Of course.  There are no miracles or free lunches in audio.  I purposely did not play the Maggies the entire time I had auditioned the R5Bi's, but as soon as I inserted my first CD, Goliath appeared in all his magnificent glory.  Not many tower speakers, up to and including those in the 10 to 15 grand range, move me the way Maggies can, and certainly not any bookshelf speaker.  But for what I was seeking, and at such a minuscule price that I thought was impossible, these little R5Bi's not only did their job, they did it exceptionally well.  By the way, did I ever tell you how elegant and beautiful the E5Bi's look in that deep red burl high-gloss finish?",2015-05-02

I'm a &#34;headphone snob&#34; and I'm really picky about all aspects of these type of products. Being a fitness enthusiast and gym rat, good music is key to a great workout. First of all you get all this:<br /><br />1 pair of headphones with (1 large set of brown ear-buds already attached)<br />2 pairs of brown ear-bud replacements (1 medium & 1 small set)<br />3 pairs of clear ear-bud replacements ( 1 small, 1 medium and 1 large set)<br />1 small carrying bag<br /><br />As you can see, it's a pretty comprehensive amount of items to make sure everyone can customize their fit. I've had no problem using these earphones when I exercise. Not only do they not slip out of my ears, but the cord is nice and long. This means I don't have to interrupt my weight training routine when I attach my MP3 to my arm. Additionally, the cord does not get tangle due to the material (heavy duty fabric) that covers it. Very smart. It's very well constructed for people who constantly throw their earphones in and out of their gym bag. The main thing I like is the sound.

I love being able to take old an useless things and make them useful again and have done so with previous mini amp. Kinda like what they did with Betty White.<br /><br />I found some Quasar speakers rated up to 100w with a frequency range of 50hz at the low end that were in decent shape. I have no idea of the brand (if they are considered 'good') but with this mini amp they sound GREAT. I'm not up on the technicalities or internal specs of this amp so I can only give you my results and let others discuss the finer details. I wasn't even sure if the amp would power really I always look to overpower speakers but it does it like a champ.<br /><br />Dead silent and a slow power down so they are not going to damage the speaker. I really can't dial the amp volume up any further than about a third of the way before they are too loud for the living space and up to bout half way for the performance space. Build quality is excellent and although limited in input options it really does allow some new life into these old speakers.<br /><br />I did a quick video although with these caveats. Recording sound through the camera mic is just to give an idea it is by no means scientific. It was taken in a small hall / room that used to be a dance studio and we could push the amp combo up to 'too loud' levels without any bad distortion except maybe on the guitar heavy stuff on occasion. At normal to loud levels it was brilliant.<br /><br />Still I like it enough I did a quick video showing the amp of and some tunes with my setup.<br /><br />Product provided for review from the folks at Gemini Doctor - its just my opinion,2015-03-30

I own the Klipsch KMC 3,the Iloud,the UE BOOM,the Bose Sounddock Portable,JBL Charge Portable,JBL Micro 2,Altec Lansing iM7,Beats Pill XL and the list goes on !!!!    The Soundcast Melody cost me three hundred and fifty dollars at Best buy, after two weeks I returned it for a refunded. The Soundcast Melody does not sound as good as the Klipsch KMC 3,the Iloud,the Bose Sounddock Portable,the Beats Pill XL nor the Altec Lansing iM7 !    The Soundcast Melody is lacking a tweeter and that is a MAJOR FLAW !!!!  The one thing that all of the speakers above have that the Soundcast Melody does not is a tweeter !    The Soundcast Melody does not have the full sound quality that the other portables I mentioned have!!!!!    The vocals in the Soundcast Melody are not up to par,they are not as clear and as refined like they are with my best portables !  When I turn the volume up loud with the Soundcast Melody the vocals get really really really distorted ! No my unit was not defective!The vocals on the ILOUD at the same loud volume is GREAT !    The Soundcast Melody plays reasonably loud,but ALL OF MY BEST PORTABLES PLAY LOUDER WITH FAR BETTER CLARITY !!!!    I purchased the  Soundcast Melody because it is Weather Resistant and it plays music in all directions and both of those features sounded GREAT to me !!!!!    But the Soundcast Melody DOES NOT SOUND GREAT compared to the other speakers I named as my best portables!The KMC 3 BLOWS THE Soundcast Melody AWAY in Volume,Bass,Treble, CLARITY !!!! Matter of fact the ILOUD which is a very very small speaker, sounds better and plays louder than the Soundcast Melody ! Plus the Soundcast Melody is heavy and too large to be carrying very far !    If I was to pick only one of my best speakers to carry around with me all the time,I WOUND PICK THE \\""ILOUD\\"" !!!!!!    The KMC 3 may have a richer and fuller sound but,it's big and heavy !

If you want a speaker that is Large,heavy,Weather Resistant and it plays music in all directions but does not sound good, but sounds OK,and is VERY EXPENSIVE \\""LOL\\"" you may want to listen to the  Soundcast Melody.

Rotating it 90 degrees(portrait vs landscape) made it get some new channels and lose some existing ones.<br />I bought it without the amplifier. A good new TV won't need it since it is automatically adjusting the gain based on the signal strength for each frequency band, so I don't buy the statement that an indoor amplifier will increase the range with 15 miles every time is used. That amplifier might be useful if you plan to split the signal to go in other rooms.<br />Many people are ignoring the signal quality at the expense of strength. For HDTV is not as important as it was for the analog signal, but it will still produce pixelation for low quality even if the signal is strong. The issue with the omni-directional antennas is that they can easily get a degraded  signal because of reflections and other RF digital devices that are common nowadays.<br />I compared the results with with a small unidirectional Philips antenna and the latter came on top for each channel. The drawback was that I had to reorient the Philips antenna for each station, whereas the 1byone stayed in same place. One of the most annoying things about the indoor antennas like this one is that people moving around the room will alter the electromagnetic field around it and produce loss of signal strength or quality.<br />To avoid that you have to find an isolated spot in the house, or better yet to get an outdoor antenna and mount it outside the house high on a pole. If the cable run is long it's best to use an outdoor pre-amplifier.",2015-05-29

Catches on Fire and Melts.,So I bought this on July 20th 2014 and last week I walked into house and smelled something like plastic burning. I ‘sniffed’ around till I came to my Beats Pill XL and found the OFE (owner furnished equipment) power supply had malfunctioned and overheated to the point of melting in the speaker power socket. In short: the plug that connects power from the Beats cord into the speaker melted into the speaker. The entire speaker smelled like it had burned on the inside. I contacted Apple and I sent it back to them for warranty repair and they told me this was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost me $189.00 if I wanted it repaired. Whatever! 1st after owning this for 8 months I would not buy it again…it’s just not worth $300. 2nd I don’t feel like it is work $189 either. 3rd I’ll be danged (I don’t like to cuss – even though I want to) if I’m going to give a company $189 to fix something that should not have melted in the 1st place. So my review: Buy something cheaper…because at least if it breaks you are not out so much money!,2015-03-25

It biggest problem is that it is mounted on a connector that wants to twist, making it easy for the microphone to rotate closer or further from your mouth as you move your head.  If it rotates closer it will pick up your breathing, and if it rotates further away then the volume won't be as loud.<br />Probably from constantly fiddling with the  boom to adjust it, I've broken the cable after only 6 months.

Vocals aren't as crystalline as I'd like, but they still sound good, if a little rounded.<br /><br />These are best for rock and pop or any other music that doesn't depend on the precise distinction of individual instruments, although female pop artists can sound less impressive than with quality, higher-end earphones.  In classical music, the violins aren't as sharp as they are in real life, and female jazz vocalists are not sharply defined.  But rock and pop sound great with these, especially given their price point.  (You aren't going to get high-fidelity with earphones under $50.)  These compete really well with other earphones with similar retail prices, outdoing many.<br /><br />I love that Brainwavz always includes a case with their earphones and headphones.  These comes with a good selection of tips for fit -- get the right ones before you judge the sound quality because they must fit snugly in the ear canal.  The hard, zippered case has two pouches and a detachable Velcro strap for keeping the cord organized.<br /><br />These offer much better sound than cheap earphones. For their retail price, these are excellent.  Note:  I received a sample for review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",2015-02-05

Finally, the ear tips are prone to popping off, and as of this morning I can no longer find them, which means now the headphones are useless. Though I've had these for a little over a year, I never wore them all that much, so considering how little use they got, it's really disappointing that they're now headed for the trash.

I use mine indoors at about 30ft. high so I don't need a rotor as I can turn the antenna by hand should it quit turning. One thing...

It's hard to fully compare it to the original, but this one does seem to be sturdier. I'm not mounting the same TV with this mount, so the weight is a bit less, but the sag that was apparent before is noticeably gone from the updated model. It does appear that they have fixed the strength issues with this model and it can support the claimed amount without worry. So far we are happier with the updated model.<br /><br />As stated below, what makes Cheetah great is the customer service provided in tandem with SPN Performance. They really want to ensure their customers are satisfied and that level of service is extremely impressive.<br /><br />Original review: I'm at about 85% of the listed 66 lb weight limit with this, and it's bending like crazy. I regret the purchase, should have spent a few dollars more and purchased something more sturdy. It does hold, but I'm afraid it will break.<br /><br />The tilting back swivel won't stay upright at all, so the TV is constantly facing downward, you'll need to hang the TV a bit higher than normal if it's heavy.<br /><br />This would probably be ok if you have a light TV, but if it's over 40 lbs, I'd go with something else.<br /><br />Update: Cheetah Customer service is great. This gives them another star. They saw this review and sent me a new mount at no cost which fixed the issue.",2015-05-10

They never will; at least none that I have ever owned or tried. This pair sounds better than any wired earbuds I have heard and they are plenty loud AND they are wireless! Since earbuds are inherently bright, flatten out the treble and crank up a little bass with EQ and these will sound great.<br /><br />The quality of construction is high as well. It's amazing that they can pack all that sound and the Bluetooth hardware and the battery in that small package.<br /><br />The Bluetooth range on these is not very far,about average, but you really can't expect them to be. There is simply not enough room in there for a super strong transmitter (yet), but as a companion to your smart phone these are perfect. They do fine though through at least 1 wall and 20 or so feet in my house.<br /><br />The packaging on this is really nice as well... it opens like a book cover and the phones are displayed inside.

None of them has all the extra ports on the back which enable to use your speaker multiple ways. My personal favorite is the Micro SD slot. I have no other bluetooth speaker that has this, and I was not even aware that this one did until I opened the box! This is the epitome of portability! Instead of lugging your tablet, laptop, or phone around, you are able to load music onto a micro sd, and insert it directly into the speaker for true music on the go.<br /><br />I was also happy with the inclusion of the aux cord. Many speakers may have the place on them to hook one up, but do not actually include the wire necessary to USE it.<br /><br />The sound is very good quality, especially for the price, although heavier on treble than bass.<br /><br />It was fairly loud and I was able to hear it throughout the house, which I was happy about. That way it's not necessary to take it room to room!<br /><br />The battery life is excellent, and days later I still have not needed to recharge the speaker, which is a great thing because I always forget to charge up my devices! I really appreciate being able to review in exchange for my honest opinion.<br /><br />Keep the speaker stored in the original box, which also offers great portability, and is just the right size to bring along in the car and keep stashed in the glove compartment until time to use it.<br /><br />Overall a great choice for the budget conscious!",2015-03-05

The issue is that your sweat will short out the controls on the cord connecting the two earpieces.

You will try to reset the earpieces, and it might work until the next time you workout/sweat in them.  Eventually (one or two charges later), they will not charge.

I am able to pick up every station within a 50-60 mile radius and that's with it mounted in my attic.  In my case, that makes up for one major shortcoming - the rotor system.  As an engineer, I would seriously consider redesigning that, or even eliminating it.  It's horrible - no real control over which direction it turns, and no indication of where it's aimed.  The remote control used to rotate the antenna has one button, and that's a crap shoot.  The antenna turns in an unpredictable direction, then toggles in the opposite direction (sometimes) when the button is pressed a second time.  There is no indication on the control box other than a small green LED that lights when it is &#34;moving&#34;.  It's worse than a game of &#34;Pin the Tail on the Donkey&#34;.  Theoretically, you could watch the &#34;signal strength&#34; indicator on your TV screen (if you have one), but they are not updated in real time due to streamed buffering (another subject).  I've never seen an antenna rotor that has no control over direction or indicator of position.  If you really need to rotate it, buy a real antenna rotator.

Second problem...sometimes you put a disc in and for some reason the polishing well just.....stops. I added more spray lube which comes with it, no go. Next, unless your disc has a scratch made by a down feather, its not great at removing deeper scratches, and what i mean by thatvare NORMAL wear and tear scratches, not ones that go WAY into the disc surface. Its just not a great system for decent rejeuvination. Sorry? And by the way,  the cleaner and &#34;disc rejuvenator&#34; bottles they send are about the size of a Visene bottle.

I payed more for next day shipping as I was leaving town and I got the product in great shape, not even a scratch on the box..<br /><br />To start, you can barely find anywhere on the packaging that this product was indeed the 2nd generation of the Momentum line... I Actually thought they (Amazon) messed up.<br /><br />The box itself was a pain to get open. It is a box inside of a slightly larger box that you must jiggle out, apparently flaps were too hard..<br /><br />The case for the M2s looks cool. But it is a weird felt material over a piece of cardboard. I had a pair of Bose on ear noise canceling headphones that came in a beautiful hard cover case with a solid feeling mesh on top. For the same price of course.<br /><br />The build of the M2s is all  around as expected. The adjustment is done via sliding not clicking which seems nice and I hope it works well long term.<br />The enlarged cup is as good as everyone says, you can wear them for days! why dont they make the cords braided?<br /><br />My left ear cup came with an error. In the middle of the foam I can feel a large piece of something. It is not present on the right ear and although not devastating I did just spend $350 and would have liked some consistency.. It is also annoying as I can feel it whenever handling the M2s. The cups on the sides of the M2s are plastic and feel well, cheap.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY: I pray for Sennheiser's sake that there is actually something wrong with my pair. I listen to a lot of music, on a lot of good equipment. It is probably my biggest hobby. I know what good is, and I know what bad is. When first listening, it sounded like I was listening to a pair of $20 over ears you find in line at a grocery store from a brand you dont know with Hello Kitty painted on the cups... The sound was hallow, distant and really nothing (highs lows or mids) sounded good on any type of song (classical, techno, pop, new age). after I let them break in a bit (1 hour or so with a variety of music) I brought them to my computer where I could play with the EQ settings. Eventually after 25 minutes I think I found something that works kinda... But it is no where close to a flat EQ set. The treble is spiked with base up and the mids in variation. Absolutely ridiculous! Especially when most people do not even know what an EQ is or how to access it! It would be easier to listen to the laptops speakers and we all know how those sound (if you say you dont mind them or dont realize they suck then save your money and buy the Hello Kitty headphones..).<br /><br />Now- mine may be broken.  The left side is producing more of a base punch then my right. again, RIDICULOUS! I tested this by flipping them and I heard the punch on the opposite side after the flip so it is not my ears being popped or something equally as stupid. The stats boast a 14hz or something range (Below what humans can actually hear btw...) and in my base heavy music of which I am well versed and the M2s could not handle them when my $15 earbuds could (skullcandy* - a my brainwavez and the Bose can hit the low frequencies as well....).<br /><br />Once I get back from this trip I will fix this post if I can get a replacement.in a bit (1 hour or so with a variety of music) I brought them to my computer where I could play with the EQ settings.

I tried to use it in my kitchen that's only a few feet away from my pc with no walls but it disconnects and makes a loud sound that doesn't stop until I go through the arduous process of clicking through a bunch of windows till I reconnect it, at which point after a few minutes it disconnects again.  It had such a high rating, I figured it'd be at least decent.  The sound quality?  Like a cheap transistor radio.  At first I couldn't even listen to it it was so harsh and tinny.  So now I use it very occasionally for only a few feet away, spoken word only (no music, it'll make you hate music)  hoping that maybe this time the Bluetooth will stay connected.

I am no audiophile but I do recognize quality when I hear it and these headphone got it. I love how they stay in place no matter what chore or activity I got going on. The hooks or fins you see there are removable if you want but when I did removed them I quickly put them back and adjusted them a little bit forward and found my sweetspot they wont budge now and are comfortable so far for all day use, or at least until the battery dies. Of course we can't have it all. and I do wish the battery lasted longer but I also wish my car was faster, had better milage per gallon, my house was bigger, had a bigger salary, lower mortgage and lifetime supply of pizza, but it's not going to happen. yes the battery lasts a maximum of only 6 hours but its fine and a 1 hour charge is a small price to pay for these great comfortable headphones. Besides, all my other bluetooth headphones are way bigger, heavier and bulkier and at best they only last a couple hours longer. What we have here is maximum battery life with minimum weight and size. So theres no way I'm going to remove a star just for that, it would be ridiculous, besides there is no false advertising, you know what your getting into if you read the description or even the title first.<br /><br />I own an iphone 6plus and of my 4 or 5 previous bluetooth headsets these paired the fastest. One of my biggest dissapointments with a bluetooth headset was also the most surprising one, my LG hbs750's. These were my most expensive ones that I bought at retail price and they here horrible, not just horrible for the price, but just plain horrible. If I had listened to them through a blind test i would have bet all my money that they were a generic set that sold for $5 max. Anyways my taotronics sound so much better than them and I paid less than $20 for them. There are no unreasonable disconnects. I listen to spotify andgoogle music on these as  well as many podcasts and everything sounds amazing. I have taken long naps with these and they don't fall out.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised as well, when I noticed there were extra ear fins in case the other ones tear or deteriorate. Or they might have been for different sized ears, I cant remember.<br /><br />Now if you were to ask me what I would chage about these headphones if I had the power to do so maybe I'd make the cable an inch or two shorter and I'd seperate the buttons more so I wouldnt have to feel around to figure out which one is which, I'd also make the outer buttons bigger than the inner button. i guess thats all I'd change. I'm very happy with everything else, these might be my go to headphones from now on. I think i might get a backup set just in case, they might just bump up the price soon if the demand rises.",2015-05-17

This competes with the jawbone wireless speaker similarly to the one you would find in the Apple store. With hearing the bluetooth speakers in the Apple store and comparing the Photive Cyren to them, I think this speaker is great. I have owned this speaker for about 6 months now and I love it. However, do not EXPECT this speaker to be more than it is. It is a higher quality Bluetooth portable speaker, great for taking to work or outside when having a small bbq or things of that nature. Just like most speakers, if you blast it to full volume, the sound will get fuzzy. If you are an audiophile and really want to hear every tone, pitch, wave length, this probably isn't for you. This will NOT replace your home theater sound system or even be one.<br /><br />The speaker is not that big, it is like holding an iPhone 6(sorry for all the Apple references lol)in your hand, except fatter. It comes with a pouch,auxiliary cord, and the mini usb charge cord. It does NOT come with the wall usb charge port/plug that comes with any phone. However, if you own a cell phone, you can use the same plug to charge it. The battery does last a fairly long time, and the Bluetooth connection range is pretty solid although I have not seriously tested the range. This may seem obvious but when you are not using the speaker anymore, make sure manually turn it off, that will give it a much longer battery life per charge. I recently found out that multiple objects can connect to this speaker at once but it will only accept one object to play from at a time. For example, if you and your friend are both connected to this device, whomever most recently connected to it; their music/sounds would be playing as opposed to yours. Again, I did not experiment too much with this but I thought it would be helpful information. In conclusion, I absolutely think the Bluetooth wireless speaker competes with those in the 100dollar price range and is great for taking to work, listening to music while showering(IT IS NOT WATERPROOF SO OBVIOUSLY THE ACTUAL SPEAKER WOULD NOT BE IN THE SHOWER), playing music for a small gathering outside etc. and I think it is a great purchase.",2015-03-27

Of course after I wrote a glowing review on their website. I still give it  3 stars, maybe I just got a dud. It makes streaming TIDAL sound twice as good as the headphone output on my moto g. If only it lasted longer. I guess I will try another dac a little further up the food chain next time. I just wanted this one to work for a while longer than it did.

The separation between the instruments is remarkable; it has good &#34;airiness&#34;.  The player has excellent dynamic range.  The player is fairly neutral, just warm enough to give saxophones throatiness.  The built-in equalizer works well and allowed me to tune the output to my speakers perfectly.<br /><br />The only flaw I see in this unit is that the receptacle for the micro SD card requires a bit of finesse to properly insert and remove the tiny card.

It uses three separate smaller suction cups verses a single large suction with most other mounts. This gives you extra security when attaching the mount to things. If for some reason one or two suction cups weren't fully attached, one suction cup with still securely hold the mount and camera. It's a solid mount that is probably the heaviest built mount on the market.<br /><br />The tripod mount consists of three vulcanized car rubber suction cups that are help firmly to the base plate by heavy duty nuts and bolts. The base plate is a heavy duty, flexible piece of plastic that can accommodate a curved surface. The tripod adapter is made of solid aluminum and is attached through the center of the base plate. The tripod mount is specially fitted to be rotated almost 180 degrees, which is nice because on most other GoPro tripod mounts you are only able to rotate it about 140 degrees. It also comes with a thumbscrew that is almost identical to the UK Pro high torque thumbscrews.<br /><br />The unit as a whole is a very solid unit. I have tested it in many places that include: on cars, windows, sunroofs, headlights, deck glass, airplane windows, and many other places. I have never had it fall off or even have one of the suction cups come off. As long as it's a smooth surface and you wipe it quickly before, the mount should be secure. This is probably one of the most universal mounts you could buy. It's small form factor also allows me to take it with me anywhere.<br /><br />On a side note, they also have a tripod adapter for other cameras. Not sure how heavy it could handle.<br /><br />Conclusion: An amazing mount. Definitely well worth the money! I would highly recommend!",2015-02-19

They ranged in price from $300 - $1,000.  They were all ok, but did not seem to be a step up from the headphone output on my Parasound preamp.  So, based on what I read on the internet I ordered the Magni 2 uber.  It is definitely a step up from my preamp.  On &#34;Alone&#34; by Hilliard Greene I can hear the beginning of the martele bow stroke and the slight buzz of the strings on his bass as they are plucked.  The bass is solid, not overpowering, just there in the right amount.  Having he gain switch is a definite plus, I have very sensitive cans and would be hard pressed to adjust the volume without it.  Singers such as Jane Olivar, Judith Owen and Mary Chapin-Carpenter come through crystal clear, solid but without the sibilance some amps seem to generate.  The noise floor is very low, it's all I can do to hear any hiss with the volume all the way up.  Nice job folks!",2015-01-04

The speaker is built solidly enough so that you know you are getting what you pay for. The sound quality is exceptional and the bass moves so much air that you can actually see the results (i.e. blowing a piece of paper of the table.) The bluetooth connection is solid so far with no issues. A couple nuisance gripes that I don't find worthy enough to take away from it's overall rating:<br /><br />1. 8 D cell batteries: I know that they did the removable batteries vs built-in battery for purposes of longevity, I just wish there was a more mainstream way to get a hold of rechargeable D cell batteries (this may be a gripe more about the batteries in the long run.)<br /><br />2. Remote: The remote is a very good addition. However, I find that it can be temperamental trying to get it in the correct line of site to &#34;talk to&#34; the speaker.<br /><br />3. No smartphone app: This speaker may have been released/designed before thoughts of &#34;app-interface&#34; was big, and I'm not horribly big on everything being controlled by smart device. However, having just traded in the UE Megaboom for this I have to say, the app was a very nice touch from Logitech.<br /><br />Overall, the speaker gets 5 Stars based on the SPEAKER Build, Performance, Sound Quality and it was worth it's cost.",2015-03-25

These headphones are small and light, and totally designed for portable use.  They fit comfortably on my head and are very light, barely noticeable even for long periods of time. These are on-ear (not over-the-ear) headphones, so they do a decent job of reducing or blocking external noise. I had them on while walking through downtown San Francisco and did not hear any external sounds. I did hear the noise of the trains when entering the BART station but the headphones do a decent job of passively reducing noise.  From a sound perspective the Denon AH-MM200BKs are advertised as being professionally tuned for a flat equalizer response that delivers a neutral listening experience. To my ears the headphones do deliver a relatively flat response with very good detail. Listening to Blood Sweat & Tears second album right now and hearing very clearly the thump of the bass and drums, clear piano, and good natural sound from the horns. I also tested these headphones with music from The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Dave Brubeck, Ella Fitzgerald, and classical music. Burn-in time so far has been about 15 hours.  The headphones have 30mm drivers. Larger drivers tend to produce lower frequencies (bass) better as they push more air. Smaller drivers are better at creating higher frequency sounds as they can move faster. Although the drivers are relatively large (given the small size of the headphone) the highs don't seem to suffer.  Denon provides two 2 detachable oxygen-free copper cables with gold plated connectors. One cable has remote function buttons for iOS devices. They also provide a travel bag (not a hard case) and the earcups fold-in for travel.  Denon also has music player apps available in both iTunes and Google Play. I downloaded the app and it offers a decent listening experience (with an equalizer with presets as well as the ability to tailor your own preset) but it is not needed for these headphones and does not add anything extra, although it is an improvement over the stock equalizer available on iOS devices.  Overall, I like these headphones a lot. They are small yet deliver big sound with good detail. They appear to be well-made and are comfortable, but I am not sure how they will hold up with daily use, especially without a hard travel case. Still, the Denon's provide optimal sound in a relatively small, travel-friendly package. Highly recommended.",2015-04-14
